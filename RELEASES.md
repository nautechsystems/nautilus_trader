### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `Actor.subscribe_order_book_snapshots` and `unsubscribe_order_book_snapshots` to `subscribe_order_book_at_interval` and `unsubscribe_order_book_at_interval` respectively (this clarifies the method behavior where the handler then receives `OrderBook` at a regular interval, distinct from a collection of deltas representing a snapshot)

### Fixes

- Changed `Order.to_dict()` `commission` and `linked_order_id` fields to lists of strings rather than comma separated strings
- Changed `OrderMatchingEngine` to no longer process internally aggregated bars for execution (no tests failed, but still classifying as a behavior change), thanks for reporting @davidsblom

### Fixes
- Fixed `CashAccount` PnL and balance calculations (was adjusting filled quantity based on open position quantity - causing a desync and incorrect balance values)
- Fixed `from_str` for `Price`, `Quantity` and `Money` when input string contains underscores in Rust, thanks for reporting @filipmacek

- Fixed `TimeEvent` equality (now based on the event `id` rather than the event `name`)
- Fixed `ParquetDataCatalog` bar queries by `instrument_id` which were no longer returning data (the intent is to use `bar_type`, however using `instrument_id` now returns all matching bars)

- Fixed `BacktestNode` streaming data management (was not clearing between chunks), thanks for reporting @dpmabo
- Fixed `RiskEngine` cumulative notional calculations for margin accounts (was incorrectly using base currency when selling)
- Fixed selling `Equity` instruments with `CASH` account and `NETTING` OMS incorrectly rejecting (should be able to reduce position)

- Implemented `OrderBookDeltas` pickling
- Implemented `AverageTrueRange` in Rust, thanks @rsmb7z

### Breaking Changes
- Changed `TradeId` value maximum length to 36 characters (will raise a `ValueError` if value exceeds the maximum)

- Fixed `TradeTick` size precision for PyO3 conversion (size precision was incorrectly price precision)
- Fixed `RiskEngine` cash value check when selling (would previously divide quantity by price which is too much), thanks for reporting @AnthonyVince
- Fixed FOK time in force behavior (allows fills beyond the top level, will cancel if cannot fill full size)
- Fixed IOC time in force behavior (allows fills beyond the top level, will cancel any remaining after all fills are applied)
- Fixed `LiveClock` timer behavior for small intervals causing next time to be less than now (timer then would not run)
- Fixed log level filtering for `log_level_file` (bug introduced in v1.187.0), thanks @twitu

# NautilusTrader 1.177.0 Beta

Released on 26th August 2023 (UTC).

This release includes a large breaking change to quote tick bid and ask price property and 
parameter naming. This was done in the interest of maintaining our generally explicit naming 
standards, and has caused confusion for some users in the past. Data using 'bid' and 'ask' columns should
still work with the legacy data wranglers, as columns are renamed under the hood to accommodate
this change.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `QuoteTick.bid` to `bid_price` including all associated parameters (for explicit naming standards)
- Renamed `QuoteTick.ask` to `ask_price` including all associated parameters (for explicit naming standards)

### Fixes
- Fixed execution algorithm `position_id` assignment in `HEDGING` mode
- Fixed `OrderMatchingEngine` processing of emulated orders

# NautilusTrader 1.127.0 Beta

## Release Notes

Released on 17th August 2021.

This release has again focused on core areas of the platform, including a

None

### Fixes
- Fix `DataEngine` order book subscription handling

---

# NautilusTrader 1.126.0 Beta

## Release Notes

Released on 2nd August 2021.

This release sees the completion of the initial implementation of the 
`MessageBus`, with data now being handled by Pub/Sub patterns, along with the 
additions of point-to-point and Req/Rep messaging functionality.

An `Actor` base class has been abstracted from `TradingStrategy` which allows
custom components to be added to a `Trader` which aren't necessarily trading 
strategies, opening up further possibilities for extending NautilusTrader with 
custom functionality.

For the sake of simplicity and to favour more idiomatic Python, the null object
pattern is no longer utilized for handling identifiers. This has removed a layer
of 'logical indirection' in certain parts of the codebase, and allows for simpler 
code.

An order is now considered 'in-flight' if it is actively pending a state 
transition i.e. in the `SUBMITTED`,`PENDING_UPDATE` or `PENDING_CANCEL` states.

It is now a well established convention that all integer based timestamps are 
expressed in UNIX nanoseconds, therefore the `_ns` postfix has now been dropped. 
For clarity - time periods/intervals/objects where the units may not be obvious 
have retained the `_ns` postfix.

The opportunity was identified to unify the parameter naming for the concept
of object instantiation by renaming `timestamp_ns` and `ts_recv_ns` to `ts_init`.
Along the same lines, the timestamps for both event and data occurrence have 
been standardized to `ts_event`.

It is acknowledged that the frequent name changes and modifications to core 
concepts may be frustrating, however whilst still in a beta phase - we're taking 
the opportunity to lay a solid foundation for this project to continue to growth 
in the years ahead.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `timestamp_ns` to `ts_init`
- Renamed `ts_recv_ns` to `ts_event`
- Renamed various event timestamp parameters to `ts_event`
- Removed null object methods on identifiers

### Enhancements
- Added `Actor` component base class
- Added `MessageBus.register()`
- Added `MessageBus.send()`
- Added `MessageBus.request()`
- Added `MessageBus.response()`
- Added `Trader.add_component()`
- Added `Trader.add_components()`
- Added `Trader.add_log_sink()`

### Fixes
- Various Betfair adapter patches and fixes
- `ExecutionEngine` position flip logic in certain edge cases

---

# NautilusTrader 1.125.0 Beta

## Release Notes

Released on 18th July 2021.

This release introduces a major re-architecture of the internal messaging system.
A common message bus has been implemented which now handles all events via a 
Pub/Sub messaging pattern. The next release will see all data being handled by 
the message bus, see the related issue for further details on this enhancement.

Another notable feature is the introduction of the order 'in-flight' concept, 
which is a submitted order which has not yet been acknowledged by the 
trading venue. Several properties on `Order`, and methods on `Cache`, now exist
to support this.

The `Throttler` has been refactored and optimized further. There has also been
extensive reorganization of the model sub-package, standardization of identifiers
on events, along with numerous 'under the hood' cleanups and two bug fixes.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `MessageType` enum to `MessageCategory`
- Renamed `fill.order_side` to `fill.side`
- Renamed `fill.order_type` to `fill.type`
- All `Event` serialization due to domain refactorings

### Enhancements
- Added `MessageBus` class
- Added `TraderId` to `Order` and `Position`
- Added `OrderType` to OrderFilled
- Added unrealized PnL to position events
- Added order in-flight concept to `Order` and `Cache`
- Improved efficiency of `Throttler`
- Standardized events `str` and `repr`
- Standardized commands `str` and `repr`
- Standardized identifiers on events and objects
- Improved `Account` `str` and `repr`
- Using `orjson` over `json` for efficiency
- Removed redundant `BypassCacheDatabase`
- Introduced `mypy` to the codebase

### Fixes
- Fixed backtest log timestamping
- Fixed backtest duplicate initial account event

hood' code cleanup and consolidation.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `Position.opened_timestamp_ns` to `ts_opened_ns`
- Renamed `Position.closed_timestamp_ns` to `ts_closed_ns`
- Renamed `Position.open_duration_ns` to `duration_ns`

---

# NautilusTrader 1.123.0 Beta

## Release Notes

Released on 20th June 2021.

A major feature of this release is a complete re-design of serialization for the
platform, along with initial support for the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format.
The MessagePack serialization functionality has been refined and retained.

In the interests of explicitness there is now a convention that timestamps are 
named either `timestamp_ns`, or prepended with `ts`. Timestamps which are 
represented with an `int64` are always in nanosecond resolution, and appended 
with `_ns` accordingly.

Initial scaffolding for new backtest data tooling has been added.

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed `OrderState.PENDING_REPLACE` to `OrderState.PENDING_UPDATE`
- Renamed `timestamp_origin_ns` to `ts_event_ns`
- Renamed `timestamp_ns` for data to `ts_recv_ns`
- Renamed `updated_ns` to `ts_updated_ns`
- Renamed `submitted_ns` to `ts_submitted_ns`
- Renamed `rejected_ns` to `ts_rejected_ns`
- Renamed `accepted_ns` to `ts_accepted_ns`
- Renamed `pending_ns` to `ts_pending_ns`
- Renamed `canceled_ns` to `ts_canceled_ns`
- Renamed `triggered_ns` to `ts_triggered_ns`
- Renamed `expired_ns` to `ts_expired_ns`
- Renamed `execution_ns` to `ts_filled_ns`
- Renamed `OrderBookLevel` to `BookLevel`
- Renamed `Order.volume` to `Order.size`

### Enhancements

# NautilusTrader 1.121.0 Beta

## Release Notes

Released on 30th May 2021.

In this release there has been a major change to the use of inlines for method
signatures. From the Cython docs:
_"Note that class-level cdef functions are handled via a virtual function table
so the compiler wonât be able to inline them in almost all cases."_.
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/pyrex_differences.html?highlight=inline.

It has been found that adding `inline` to method signatures makes no difference
to the performance of the system - and so they have been removed to reduce 
'noise' and simplify the codebase. Note that the use of `inline` for 
module level functions will be passed to the C compiler with the expected 
result of inlining the function.

### Breaking Changes
- `BacktestEngine.add_venue` added `venue_type` to method params
- `ExecutionClient` added `venue_type` to constructor params
- `TraderId` instantiation
- `StrategyId` instantiation
- `Instrument` serialization

### Enhancements
- `Portfolio` pending calculations if data not immediately available
- Added `instruments` subpackage with expanded class definitions
- Added `timestamp_origin_ns` timestamp when originally occurred
- Added `AccountState.is_reported` flagging if reported by exchange or calculated
- Simplified `TraderId` and `StrategyId` identifiers
- Improved `ExecutionEngine` order routing
- Improved `ExecutionEngine` client registration
- Added order routing configuration
- Added `VenueType` enum and parser
- Improved param typing for identifier generators
- Improved log formatting of `Money` and `Quantity` thousands commas

### Fixes
- CCXT `TICK_SIZE` precision mode - size precisions (BitMEX, FTX)
- State reconciliation (various bugs)

---

# NautilusTrader 1.120.0 Beta

- `TradingCommand` serialization

### Enhancements
- Added `Instrument` methods to `ExecutionCache`
- Added `Venue` filter to cache queries
- Moved order validations into `RiskEngine`
- Refactored `RiskEngine`
- Removed routing type information from identifiers

### Fixes
None

---

# NautilusTrader 1.119.0 Beta

## Release Notes

This release applies another major refactoring to the value object API for
`BaseDecimal` and its subclasses `Price` and `Quantity`. Previously a precision
was not explicitly required when passing in a `decimal.Decimal` type which
sometimes resulted in unexpected behavior when a user passed in a decimal with
a very large precision (when wrapping a float with `decimal.Decimal`).

Convenience methods have been added to `Price` and `Quantity` where precision
is implicitly zero for ints, or implied in the number of digits after the '.'
point for strings. Convenience methods have also been added to `Instrument` to
assist the UX.

The serialization of `Money` has been improved with the inclusion of the 
currency code in the string delimited by whitespace. This avoids an additional
field for the currency code.

`RiskEngine` has been rewired ahead of `ExecutionEngine` which clarifies areas
of responsibility and cleans up the registration sequence and allows a more
natural flow of command and event messages.

### Breaking Changes
- Serializations involving `Money`
- Changed usage of `Price` and `Quantity`
- Renamed `BypassExecutionDatabase` to `BypassCacheDatabase`

### Enhancements
- Rewired `RiskEngine` and `ExecutionEngine` sequence
- Added `Instrument` database operations
- Added `MsgPackInstrumentSerializer`
- Added `Price.from_str()`
- Added `Price.from_int()`
- Added `Quantity.zero()`
- Added `Quantity.from_str()`
- Added `Quantity.from_int()`
- Added `Instrument.make_price()`
- Added `Instrument.make_qty()`
- Improved serialization of `Money`

### Fixes
- Handling of precision for `decimal.Decimal` values passed to value objects

---

# NautilusTrader 1.118.0 Beta

## Release Notes

This release simplifies the backtesting workflow by removing the need for the 
intermediate `BacktestDataContainer`. There has also been some simplifications
for `OrderFill` events, as well as additional order states and events.

### Breaking Changes
- Standardized all 'cancelled' references to 'canceled'.
- `SimulatedExchange` no longer generates `OrderAccepted` for `MarketOrder`
- Removed redundant `BacktestDataContainer`
- Removed redundant `OrderFilled.cum_qty`
- Removed redundant `OrderFilled.leaves_qty`
- `BacktestEngine` constructor simplified

- Added `OrderFilled.is_sell` property (with corresponding `is_sell_c()` fast method)
- Added `Position.is_opposite_side(OrderSide side)` convenience method
- Modified the `Order` FSM and event handling for the above
- Consolidated event generation into `ExecutionClient` base class
- Refactored `SimulatedExchange` for greater clarity

### Fixes

- Exchange accounting for exchange `OmsType.NETTING`
- Position flipping logic for exchange `OmsType.NETTING`
- Multi-currency account terminology
- Windows wheel packaging
- Windows path errors

---

# NautilusTrader 1.117.0 Beta

## Release Notes

The major thrust of this release is added support for order book data in
backtests. The `SimulatedExchange` now maintains order books of each instrument
and will accurately simulate market impact with L2/L3 data. For quote and trade
tick data a L1 order book is used as a proxy. A future release will include 
improved fill modelling assumptions and customizations.

### Breaking Changes
- `OrderBook.create` now takes `Instrument` and `BookLevel`

### Enhancements
- `SimulatedExchange` now maintains order books internally
- `LiveLogger` now exhibits better blocking behavior and logging

# NautilusTrader 1.115.0 Beta

## Release Notes

**This release includes substantial breaking changes.**

Due to recent feedback and much further thought - a major renaming has been carried
out involving order identifiers. The `Order` is the only domain object in the
model which is identified with more than one ID. Due to this, more explicitness
helps to ensure correct logic. Previously the `OrderId` was
implicitly assumed to be the one assigned by the trading venue. This has been
clarified by renaming the identifier to `VenueOrderId`. Following this, it no
longer made sense to refer to it through `Order.id`, and so this was changed to
its full name `Order.venue_order_id`. This naturally resulted in `ClientOrderId`(s)
being renamed in properties and variables from `cl_ord_id` to `client_order_id`.

### Breaking Changes
- Rename `OrderId` to `VenueOrderId`
- Rename `Order.id` to `Order.venue_order_id`
- Rename `Order.cl_ord_id` to `Order.client_order_id`
- Rename `AssetClass.STOCK` to `AssetClass.EQUITY`
- Remove redundant flag `generate_position_ids` (handled by `OmsType`)

### Enhancements
- Introduce integration for Betfair.
- Add `AssetClass.METAL` and `AssetClass.ENERGY`
- Add `VenueStatusEvent`, `InstrumentStatusEvent` and `InstrumentClosePrice`
- Usage of `np.ndarray` to improve function and indicator performance

### Fixes
- LiveLogger log message when blocking.

in the system (prefer throwing exceptions)

---

# NautilusTrader 1.112.0 Beta

## Release Notes

**This release includes substantial breaking changes.**

The platforms internal timestamping has been standardized to nanoseconds. This
decision was made to increase the accuracy of backtests to nanosecond precision,
improve data handling including order book and custom data for backtesting, and
to future-proof the platform to a more professional standard. The top-level user
API still takes `datetime` and `timedelta` objects for usability.

There has also been some standardization of naming conventions to align more
closely with established financial market terminology with reference to the
FIX5.0 SP2 specification, and CME MDP 3.0.

### Breaking Changes
- Move `BarType` into `Bar` as a property
- Change signature of `Bar` handling methods due to above
- Remove `Instrument.leverage` (incorrect place for concept)
- Change `ExecutionClient.venue` as a `Venue` to `ExecutionClient.name` as a `str`
- Change serialization of timestamp datatype to `int64`

# NautilusTrader 1.110.0 Beta

## Release Notes

This release applies one more major change to the identifier API. `Security` has
been renamed to `InstrumentId` for greater clarity that the object is an identifier,
and to group the concept of an instrument with its identifier.

Data objects in the framework have been further abstracted to prepare for the
handling of custom data in backtests.

A `RiskEngine` base class has also been scaffolded.

### Breaking Changes
- `Security` renamed to `InstrumentId`
- `Instrument.security` renamed to `Instrument.id`
- `Data` becomes an abstract base class with `timestamp` and `unix_timestamp`
  properties
- `Data` and `DataType` moved to `model.data`
- `on_data` methods now take `GenericData`

### Enhancements
- Add `GenericData`
- Add `Future` instrument

### Fixes
None

# NautilusTrader 1.109.0 Beta

## Release Notes

The main thrust of this release is to refine and further bed down the changes
to the identifier model via `InstrumentId`, and fix some bugs.

Errors in the CCXT clients caused by the last release have been addressed.

### Breaking Changes
- `InstrumentId` now takes first class value object `Symbol`
- `InstrumentId` `asset_class` and `asset_type` no longer optional
- `SimulatedExchange.venue` changed to `SimulatedExchange.id`

### Enhancements
- Ensure `TestTimer` advances monotonically increase
- Add `AssetClass.BETTING`

### Fixes
- CCXT data and execution clients regarding `instrument_id` vs `symbol` naming
- `InstrumentId` equality and hashing
- Various docstrings

# NautilusTrader 1.108.0 Beta

## Release Notes

This release executes a major refactoring of `Symbol` and how securities are
generally identified within the platform. This will allow a smoother integration
with Interactive Brokers and other exchanges, brokerages and trading
counterparties.

Previously the `Symbol` identifier also included a venue which confused the concept.
The replacement `Security` identifier more clearly expresses the domain with a
symbol string, a primary `Venue`, `AssetClass` and `AssetType` properties.

### Breaking Changes
- All previous serializations
- `Security` replaces `Symbol` with expanded properties
- `AssetClass.EQUITY` changed to `AssetClass.STOCK`
- `from_serializable_string` changed to `from_serializable_str`
- `to_serializable_string` changed to `to_serializable_str`

### Enhancements
- Reports now include full instrument_id name
- Add `AssetType.WARRANT`

### Fixes
- `StopLimitOrder` serialization

---

# NautilusTrader 1.107.1 Beta - Release Notes

This is a patch release which applies various fixes and refactorings.

The behavior of the `StopLimitOrder` continued to be fixed and refined.
`SimulatedExchange` was refactored further to reduce complexity.

### Breaking Changes
None

### Enhancements
None

### Fixes
- `TRIGGERED` states in order FSM
- `StopLimitOrder` triggering behavior
- `OrderFactory.stop_limit` missing `post_only` and `hidden`
- `Order` and `StopLimitOrder` `__repr__` string (duplicate id)

---

# NautilusTrader 1.107.0 Beta

## Release Notes

The main thrust of this release is to refine some subtleties relating to order
matching and amendment behavior for improved realism. This involved a fairly substantial refactoring
of `SimulatedExchange` to manage its complexity, and support extending the order types.

The `post_only` flag for LIMIT orders now results in the expected behavior regarding
when a marketable limit order will become a liquidity `TAKER` during order placement
and amendment.

Test coverage was moderately increased.

### Breaking Changes
None

### Enhancements
- Refactored `SimulatedExchange` order matching and amendment logic
- Add `risk` subpackage to group risk components

### Fixes
- `StopLimitOrder` triggering behavior
- All flake8 warnings

---

# NautilusTrader 1.106.0 Beta

## Release Notes

The main thrust of this release is to introduce the Interactive Brokers
integration, and begin adding platform capabilities to support this effort.

### Breaking Changes
- `from_serializable_string` methods changed to `from_serializable_str`

### Enhancements
- Scaffold Interactive Brokers integration in `adapters/ib`
- Add the `Future` instrument type
- Add the `StopLimitOrder` order type
- Add the `Data` and `DataType` types to support custom data handling
- Add the `InstrumentId` identifier types initial implementation to support extending the platforms capabilities

### Fixes
- `BracketOrder` correctness
- CCXT precision parsing bug
- Some log formatting
