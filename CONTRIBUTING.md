# Contributing to NautilusTrader

We highly value involvement from the trading community, and all contributions are greatly appreciated as they help us continually improve NautilusTrader!

## Steps

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. Open an issue on GitHub to discuss your proposed changes or enhancements.

2. Once everyone is aligned, fork the `develop` branch and ensure your fork is up-to-date by regularly merging any upstream changes.

3. Install and configure [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) on your local machine to automatically run code checks, formatters, and linters before each commit.
   You can install pre-commit with:
    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```

4. Open a pull request (PR) on the `develop` branch with a summary comment and reference to any relevant GitHub issue(s).

5. The CI system will run the full test suite on your code including all unit and integration tests, so include appropriate tests with the PR.

6. [Deepsource](https://deepsource.io) will perform an automated code review. Fix any issues that cause a failed check, and add the commit to your PR.

7. Read and understand the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), available at https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/blob/develop/CLA.md.

8. You will also be required to sign the CLA, which is administered automatically through [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/).

9. We will review your code as quickly as possible and provide feedback if any changes are needed before merging.

## Tips

- Follow the established coding practices in the [Developer Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/developer_guide/index.html).
- Keep PRs small and focused for easier review.
- Reference the relevant GitHub issue(s) in your PR comment.
