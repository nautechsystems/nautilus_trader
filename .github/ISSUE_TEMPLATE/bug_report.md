# Bug Report

| Term                          | Definition |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| **Bug**                       | Behavior that contradicts the platform’s documented or intended design as per code, docs, or specs. (i.e., The implementation is incorrect.) |
| **Expectation&nbsp;mismatch** | Behavior that follows the platform’s documented or intended design but differs from what you expected (i.e., The design/spec might be the problem.) |
| **Enhancement request**       | A request for new functionality or behavior that is not implied by existing design. (i.e., “It would be great if the platform could…”) |

**Note:**

- Use this template only for issues that fit the **Bug** definition; submitting it automatically applies the `bug` label.
- `bug`-labelled issues are triaged with higher priority because they require corrective implementation work.
- **Expectation mismatches** and design-level concerns should be opened as Discussions, or RFCs instead, where they can be validated and discussed to consensus before any work is scheduled.
- The absence of a feature is typically not an expectation mismatch, and should be filed as an enhancement request.

## Confirmation

**Before opening a bug report, please confirm:**

- [ ] I’ve re-read the relevant sections of the documentation.
- [ ] I’ve searched existing issues and discussions to avoid duplicates.
- [ ] I’ve reviewed or skimmed the source code (or examples) to confirm the behavior is not by design.
- [ ] I’ve confirmed the issue is reproducible with the latest development version of `nautilus_trader` (it may have been fixed already).
