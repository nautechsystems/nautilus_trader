/// Repeatedly evaluates a condition with a delay until it becomes true or a timeout occurs.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `condition` - A closure that represents the condition to be met. This closure should return `true`
///                 when the condition is met and `false` otherwise.
/// * `timeout` - The maximum amount of time to wait for the condition to be met. If this duration is
///               exceeded, the function will panic.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic if the timeout duration is exceeded without the condition being met.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::time::Duration;
/// use std::thread;
/// use nautilus_common::testing::wait_until;
///
/// let start_time = std::time::Instant::now();
/// let timeout = Duration::from_secs(5);
///
/// wait_until(|| {
///     if start_time.elapsed().as_secs() > 2 {
///         true
///     } else {
///         false
///     }
/// }, timeout);
/// ```
///
/// In the above example, the `wait_until` function will block for at least 2 seconds, as that's how long
/// it takes for the condition to be met. If the condition was not met within 5 seconds, it would panic.
