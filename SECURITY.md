# Security Policy

At NautilusTrader, we take security seriously and appreciate your efforts in 
helping us identify and fix any vulnerabilities. If you have discovered a 
security vulnerability, follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Responsible Disclosure
We encourage responsible disclosure of any security vulnerabilities you may 
discover. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our platform, 
email us at info@nautechsystems.io. We ask that you provide us with a 
reasonable amount of time (at least one week) to fix the issue before 
disclosing it publicly.

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest version of NautilusTrader. If you are using an older 
version, it is possible that vulnerabilities may have been fixed in a later 
release.

## Bug Bounty Program
At this time, we do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we 
appreciate any efforts to help us improve the security of our platform and will 
do our best to properly recognize and credit your contributions.
