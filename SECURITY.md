# Security Policy

We welcome all security reports.

There is no formal bug bounty program.

We only support the latest version (because this is beta software).

If you find a security vulnerability please email us directly at info@nautechsystems.io

We would appreciate a 1 week delay on disclosure (and are happy to jointly announce
the bug/fix) to afford us time to patch the latest prior to disclosure.
