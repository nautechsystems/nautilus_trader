# The 'pragma: no cover' comment excludes a method from test coverage.
# https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.3.3/excluding.html
# The reason for their use is to reduce redundant/needless tests which simply
# assert that a `NotImplementedError` is raised when calling abstract methods.
# These tests are expensive to maintain (as they must be kept in line with any
# refactorings), and offer little to no benefit in return. However, the intention
# is for all method implementations to be fully covered by tests.

# *** THESE PRAGMA: NO COVER COMMENTS MUST BE REMOVED IN ANY IMPLEMENTATION. ***
