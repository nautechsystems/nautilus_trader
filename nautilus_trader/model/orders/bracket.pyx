cdef class BracketOrder:
    """
    Represents a bracket order.

    A bracket order is designed to help limit a traders loss and optionally
    lock in a profit by "bracketing" an entry order with two opposite-side exit
    orders. A BUY order is bracketed by a high-side sell order and a
    low-side sell stop order. A SELL order is bracketed by a high-side buy stop
    order and a low-side buy order.

    Once the 'parent' entry order is triggered the 'child' OCO orders being a
    `StopMarketOrder` and take-profit `LimitOrder` automatically become
    working on the exchange.
