# NautilusTrader

NautilusTrader is an algorithmic trading framework allowing quantitative traders
the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical
data with an event-driven engine, and then trade them live hosted on a
```TradingNode``` with no changes to the ```TradingStrategy``` scripts.

## Features
* **Fast:** C level speed and type safety provided through Cython. ZeroMQ message transport, MsgPack wire serialization.
* **Flexible:** Any FIX or REST broker API can be integrated into the platform, with no changes to your strategy scripts.
* **Distributed:** Pluggable into distributed system architectures due to the efficient message passing API.
* **Backtesting:** Multiple instruments and strategies simultaneously with historical tick and/or bar data.
* **AI Agent Training:** Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES).
* **Teams Support:** Support for teams with many trader boxes. Suitable for professional algorithmic traders or hedge funds.
* **Cloud Enabled:** Flexible deployment schemas - run with data and execution services embedded on a single box, or deploy across many boxes in a networked or cloud environment.
* **Encryption:** Built-in encryption support with ZeroMQ. Run trading boxes remote from co-located data and execution services.

## Installation
Install the snappy c library;

    $ sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev

Install the package via pip;

    $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader


## Encryption
For effective remote deployment of a live ```TradingNode``` encryption keys must be generated by the
client trader. The currently supported encryption scheme is that which is built into ZeroMQ
being Curve25519 elliptic curve algorithms. This allows perfect forward security with ephemeral keys
being exchanged per connection. The public ```server.key``` must be shared with the trader ahead of
time and contained in the ```keys\``` directory (see below).

To generate a new client key pair from a python console or .py run the following;

    import zmq.auth
    from pathlib import Path

    keys_dir = 'path/to/your/keys'
    Path(keys_dir).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    zmq.auth.create_certificates(keys_dir, 'client')

## Live Deployment
The trader must assemble a directory including the following;

- ```config.json``` for configuration settings
- ```keys/``` directory containing the ```client.key_secret``` and ```server.key```
- ```launch.py``` referring to the strategies to run
- trading strategy python or cython files

To deploy a live ```TradingNode```, pull and run the latest docker image;

    $ docker pull nautilus_trader
    $ docker run nautilus_trader -d <path_to_trading_directory>

## Development
[Development Documentation](docs/development)

To run the tests, first compile the C extensions for the package;

    $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

All tests can be run via the `run_tests.py` script, or through pytest.
