## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,
providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies
on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform is 'AI-first', designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant
and robust Python native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest
environment, consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTraders design, architecture and implementation philosophy holds software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting Python native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting
and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal and asset class agnostic - with any REST, WebSocket or FIX API able to be integrated via modular
adapters. Thus, it can handle high-frequency trading operations for any asset classes
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, CFDs, Crypto and Betting - across multiple venues simultaneously.

## Features

- **Fast** - C-level speed through Rust and Cython. Asynchronous networking with [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)
- **Reliable** - Type safety through Rust and Cython. Redis backed performant state persistence
- **Portable** - OS independent, runs on Linux, macOS, Windows. Deploy using Docker
- **Flexible** - Modular adapters mean any REST, WebSocket, or FIX API can be integrated
- **Advanced** - Time in force `IOC`, `FOK`, `GTD`, `AT_THE_OPEN`, `AT_THE_CLOSE`, advanced order types and conditional triggers. Execution instructions `post-only`, `reduce-only`, and icebergs. Contingency order lists including `OCO`, `OTO`
- **Customizable** - Add user defined custom components, or assemble entire systems from scratch leveraging the cache and message bus
- **Backtesting** - Run with multiple venues, instruments and strategies simultaneously using historical quote tick, trade tick, bar, order book and custom data with nanosecond resolution
- **Live** - Use identical strategy implementations between backtesting and live deployments
- **Multi-venue** - Multiple venue capabilities facilitate market making and statistical arbitrage strategies
- **AI Agent Training** - Backtest engine fast enough to be used to train AI trading agents (RL/ES)

> _The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
> The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture._

## Why NautilusTrader?

- **Highly performant event-driven Python** - native binary core components
- **Parity between backtesting and live trading** - identical strategy code
- **Reduced operational risk** - risk management functionality, logical correctness and type safety
- **Highly extendable** - message bus, custom components and actors, custom data, custom adapters

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting might be conducted in Python (or other suitable language)
using vectorized methods, with the strategy then needing to be reimplemented in a more event-drive way
using C++, C#, Java or other statically typed language(s). The reasoning here is that vectorized backtesting code cannot
express the granular time and event dependent complexity of real-time trading, where compiled languages have
proven to be more suitable due to their inherently higher performance, and type safety.

One of the key advantages of NautilusTrader here, is that this reimplementation step is now circumvented - as the critical core components of the platform
have all been written entirely in Rust or Cython. This means we're using the right tools for the job, where systems programming languages compile performant binaries,
with CPython C extension modules then able to offer a Python native environment, suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straight
forward syntax. It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented
programming language. Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the _de facto lingua franca_ of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

The language out of the box is not without its drawbacks however, especially in the context of
implementing large performance-critical systems. Cython has addressed a lot of these issues, offering all the advantages
of a statically typed language, embedded into Pythons rich ecosystem of software libraries and
developer/user communities.

## What is Cython?

[Cython](https://cython.org) is a compiled programming language which aims to be a superset of the Python programming
language, designed to give C-like performance with code that is written in Python - with
optional C-inspired syntax.

The project heavily utilizes Cython to provide static type safety and increased performance
for Python through [C extension modules](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html). The vast majority of the production code is actually
written in Cython, however the libraries can be accessed from both Python and Cython.

## What is Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe
concurrency. Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient (comparable to C and C++) with no runtime or
garbage collector. It can power mission-critical systems, run on embedded devices, and easily
integrates with other languages.

Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety deterministically —
eliminating many classes of bugs at compile-time.

The project increasingly utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python language binding is handled through
Cython, with static libraries linked at compile-time before the wheel binaries are packaged, so a user
does not need to have Rust installed to run NautilusTrader. In the future as more Rust code is introduced,
[PyO3](https://pyo3.rs/latest) will be leveraged for easier Python bindings.

This project makes the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html):

> “The intent of this project is to be free of soundness bugs.
> The developers will do their best to avoid them, and welcome help in analyzing and fixing them.”

## Installation

### From PyPI

We recommend running the platform with the latest stable version of Python, and in a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies.

To install the latest binary wheel from PyPI:

    pip install -U nautilus_trader

### From Source

Installation from source requires the `Python.h` header file, which is included in development releases such as `python-dev`.
You'll also need the latest stable `rustc` and `cargo` to compile the Rust libraries.

For MacBook Pro M1/M2, make sure your Python installed using pyenv is configured with `--enable-shared`:

    PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-shared" pyenv install <python_version>

See https://pyo3.rs/latest/getting_started#virtualenvs.

It's possible to install from source using `pip` if you first install the build dependencies
as specified in the `pyproject.toml`. However, we highly recommend installing using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as below.

1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (the Rust toolchain installer):

   - Linux and macOS:
     ```
     curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
     ```
   - Windows:
     - Download and install [`rustup-init.exe`](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64)
     - Install "Desktop development with C++" with [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16)

2. Enable `cargo` in the current shell:

   - Linux and macOS:
     ```
     source $HOME/.cargo/env
     ```
   - Windows:
     - Start a new PowerShell

3. Install poetry (or follow the installation guide on their site):

   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

4. Clone the source with `git`, and install from the projects root directory:

   git clone https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader
   cd nautilus_trader
   poetry install --only main --all-extras

Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://docs.nautilustrader.io/getting_started/installation.html) for other options and further details.

## Versioning and releases

NautilusTrader is currently following a bi-weekly beta release schedule.
The API is becoming more stable, however breaking changes are still possible between releases.
Documentation of these changes in the release notes are made on a best-effort basis.

### Branches

- `master` branch will always reflect the source code for the latest released version
- `develop` branch is normally very active with frequent commits and may contain experimental features. We aim to maintain a stable
  passing build on this branch

The current roadmap has a goal of achieving a stable API for a `2.x` version. From this
point we will follow a formal process for releases, with deprecation periods for any API changes.

## Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided to automate most installation and build tasks for development. It provides the following targets:

- `make install` -- Installs in `release` build mode with `main`, `dev` and `test` dependencies then installs the package using poetry (default)
- `make install-debug` -- Same as `make install` but with `debug` build mode
- `make install-just-deps` -- Installs just the `main`, `dev` and `test` dependencies (does not install package)
- `make install-just-deps-all` -- Same as `make install-just-deps` and additionally installs `docs` dependencies
- `make build` -- Runs the Cython build script in `release` build mode (default)
- `make build-debug` -- Runs the Cython build script in `debug` build mode
- `make clean` -- **CAUTION** Cleans all non-source artifacts from the repository
- `make docs` -- Builds the documentation HTML using Sphinx
- `make pre-commit` -- Runs the pre-commit checks over all files
- `make pre-flight` -- Runs pre-commit, makes a clean debug build and runs all tests (except performance tests)
- `make ruff` -- Runs ruff over all files using the `pyproject.toml` config
- `make pytest` -- Runs all tests with `pytest` (except performance tests)
- `make pytest-coverage` -- Same as `make pytest` and additionally runs with test coverage and produces a report

## Examples

Indicators and strategies can be developed in both Python and Cython (although if performance and latency sensitivity are import we recommend Cython).
The below are some examples of this:

- [indicator](/examples/indicators/ema_python.py) example written in Python
- [indicator](/nautilus_trader/indicators/) examples written in Cython
- [strategy](/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/) examples written in both Python and Cython
- [backtest](/examples/backtest/) examples using a `BacktestEngine` directly

## Docker

Docker containers are built using a base `python:3.10-slim` with the following image variant tags:

- `nautilus_trader:latest` has the latest release version installed
- `nautilus_trader:develop` has the head of the `develop` branch installed
- `jupyterlab:develop` has the head of the `develop` branch installed along with `jupyterlab` and an
  example backtest notebook with accompanying data

The container images can be pulled as follows:

    docker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/<image_variant_tag> --platform linux/amd64

You can launch the backtest example container by running:

    docker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:develop --platform linux/amd64
    docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:develop

Then open your browser at the following address:

    http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab

| :warning: WARNING |
| :---------------- |

**NautilusTrader currently exceeds the rate limit for Jupyter notebook logging (stdout output),
this is why `log_level` in the examples is set to "ERROR". If you lower this level to see more
logging then the notebook will hang during cell execution. A fix is currently
being investigated which involves either raising the configured rate limits for
Jupyter, or throttling the log flushing from Nautilus.**

## Minimal Strategy

The following is a minimal EMA Cross strategy example which just uses bar data.
While trading strategies can become very advanced with this platform, it's still possible to put
together simple strategies. First inherit from the `Strategy` base class, then only the
methods which are required by the strategy need to be implemented.

```python
class EMACross(Strategy):
    """
    A simple moving average cross example strategy.

    When the fast EMA crosses the slow EMA then enter a position at the market
    in that direction.

    Cancels all orders and closes all positions on stop.
