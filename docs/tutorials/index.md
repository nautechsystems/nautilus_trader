# Tutorials

Welcome to the tutorials for the NautilusTrader platform! We hope these will be a helpful 
resource as you explore the different features and capabilities of the platform.

To get started, you can take a look at the table of contents on the left-hand side of the page. 
The topics are generally ordered from highest to lowest level, so you can start with the higher-level 
concepts and then dive into the more specific details as needed.

It's important to note that the [API Reference](../api_reference/index.md) documentation should be 
considered the source of truth for the platform. If there are any discrepancies between the user 
guide and the API Reference, the API Reference should be considered the correct information. We are 
working to ensure that the user guide stays up-to-date with the API Reference and will be introducing 
doc tests in the near future to help with this.

```{note}
The terms "NautilusTrader", "Nautilus" and "platform" are used interchageably throughout the documentation.
