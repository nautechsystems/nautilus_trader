# Loading External Data

This notebook runs through an example of loading raw data (external to Nautilus) into the NautilusTrader `ParquetDataCatalog`, for use in backtesting.

## The DataCatalog

The data catalog is a central store for Nautilus data, persisted in the [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) file format.

We have chosen parquet as the storage format for the following reasons:
- It performs much better than CSV/JSON/HDF5/etc in terms of compression ratio (storage size) and read performance
- It does not require any separately running components (for example a database)
- It is quick and simple to get up and running with

### Getting some sample raw data

Before we start the notebook - as a once off we need to download some sample data for loading.

For this notebook we will use FX data from `histdata.com`, simply go to https://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-historical-data/?/ascii/tick-data-quotes/ and select a Forex pair and one or more months of data to download.

Once you have downloaded the data, set the variable `input_files` below to the path containing the 
data. You can also use a glob to select multiple files, for example `"~/Downloads/HISTDATA_COM_ASCII_AUDUSD_*.zip"`.

```python
import fsspec
fs = fsspec.filesystem("file")

input_files = "~/Downloads/HISTDATA_COM_ASCII_AUDUSD_T202001.zip"
```

Run the cell below; you should see the files that you downloaded:

```python
# Simple check that the file path is correct
assert len(fs.glob(input_files)), f"Could not find files with {input_files=}"
```

### Loading data via Reader classes

We can load data from various sources into the data catalog using helper methods in the 
`nautilus_trader.persistence.external.readers` module. The module contains methods for reading 
various data formats (CSV, JSON, text), minimising the amount of code required to get data loaded 
correctly into the data catalog.

There are a handful of readers available, some notes on when to use which:
- `CSVReader` - use when your data is CSV (comma separated values) and has a header row. Each row of the data typically is one "entry" and is linked to the header.
- `TextReader` - similar to CSVReader, however used when data may container multiple 'entries' per line. For example, JSON data with multiple order book or trade ticks in a single line. This data typically does not have a header row, and field names come from some external definition. 
- `ParquetReader` - for parquet files, will read chunks of the data and process similar to `CSVReader`.

Each of the `Reader` classes takes a `line_parser` or `block_parser` function, a user defined function to convert a line or block (chunk / multiple rows) of data into Nautilus object(s) (for example `QuoteTick` or `TradeTick`).

### Writing the parser function

The FX data from `histdata` is stored in CSV (plain text) format, with fields `timestamp, bid_price, ask_price`. 

For this example, we will use the `CSVReader` class, where we need to manually pass a header (as the files do not contain one). The `CSVReader` has a couple of options, we'll be setting `chunked=False` to process the data line-by-line, and `as_dataframe=False` to process the data as a string rather than DataFrame. See the [API Reference](../api_reference/persistence.md) for more details.

```python
import datetime
import pandas as pd
from nautilus_trader.model.data.tick import QuoteTick
from nautilus_trader.model.objects import Price, Quantity
from nautilus_trader.core.datetime import dt_to_unix_nanos

def parser(data, instrument_id):
    """ Parser function for hist_data FX data, for use with CSV Reader """
    dt = pd.Timestamp(datetime.datetime.strptime(data['timestamp'].decode(), "%Y%m%d %H%M%S%f"), tz='UTC')
    yield QuoteTick(
        instrument_id=instrument_id,
        bid=Price.from_str(data['bid'].decode()),
        ask=Price.from_str(data['ask'].decode()),
        bid_size=Quantity.from_int(100_000),
        ask_size=Quantity.from_int(100_000),
        ts_event=dt_to_unix_nanos(dt),
        ts_init=dt_to_unix_nanos(dt),
    )
```

### Creating a new DataCatalog

If a `ParquetDataCatalog` does not already exist, we can easily create one. 
Now that we have our parser function, we instantiate a `ParquetDataCatalog` (passing in a directory where to store the data, by default we will just use the current directory):

```python
import os, shutil
CATALOG_PATH = os.getcwd() + "/catalog"

# Clear if it already exists, then create fresh
if os.path.exists(CATALOG_PATH):
    shutil.rmtree(CATALOG_PATH)
os.mkdir(CATALOG_PATH)
```

```python
# Create an instance of the ParquetDataCatalog
from nautilus_trader.persistence.catalog import ParquetDataCatalog
catalog = ParquetDataCatalog(CATALOG_PATH)
```

### Instruments

Nautilus needs to link market data to an instrument ID, and an instrument ID to an `Instrument` 
definition. This can be done at any time, although typically it makes sense when you are loading 
market data into the catalog.

For our example, Nautilus contains some helpers for creating FX pairs, which we will use. If
however, you were adding data for financial or crypto markets, you would need to create (and add to 
the catalog) an instrument corresponding to that instrument ID. Definitions for other 
instruments (of various asset classes) can be found in `nautilus_trader.model.instruments`.

See [Instruments](../concepts/instruments.md) for more details on creating other instruments.

```python
from nautilus_trader.persistence.external.core import process_files, write_objects
from nautilus_trader.test_kit.providers import TestInstrumentProvider

# Use nautilus test helpers to create a EUR/USD FX instrument for our purposes
instrument = TestInstrumentProvider.default_fx_ccy("EUR/USD")
```

We can now add our new instrument to the `ParquetDataCatalog`:

```python
from nautilus_trader.persistence.external.core import write_objects

write_objects(catalog, [instrument])
```

And check its existence:

```python
catalog.instruments()
```

<!-- #region -->
### Loading the files 

One final note: our parsing function takes an `instrument_id` argument, as in our case with 
hist_data, however the actual file does not contain information about the instrument, only the file name 
does. In our instance, we would likely need to split our loading per FX pair, so we can determine 
which instrument we are loading. We will use a simple lambda function to pass our instrument ID to 
the parsing function.

We can now use the `process_files` function to load one or more files using our `Reader` class and 
`parsing` function as shown below. This function will loop over many files, as well as breaking up 
large files into chunks (protecting us from out of memory errors when reading large files) and save 
the results to the `ParquetDataCatalog`.

For the hist_data, it should take less than a minute or two to load each FX file (a progress bar 
will appear below):
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
from nautilus_trader.persistence.external.core import process_files
from nautilus_trader.persistence.external.readers import CSVReader


process_files(
    glob_path=input_files,
    reader=CSVReader(
        block_parser=lambda x: parser(x, instrument_id=instrument.id), 
        header=['timestamp', 'bid', 'ask', 'volume'],
        chunked=False, 
        as_dataframe=False,
    ),
    catalog=catalog,
)
```

## Using the ParquetDataCatalog

Once data has been loaded into the catalog, the `catalog` instance can be used for loading data into 
the backtest engine, or simple for research purposes. It contains various methods to pull data from 
the catalog, such as `quote_ticks`, for example:

```python
import pandas as pd
from nautilus_trader.core.datetime import dt_to_unix_nanos

start = dt_to_unix_nanos(pd.Timestamp("2020-01-01", tz="UTC"))
end =  dt_to_unix_nanos(pd.Timestamp("2020-01-02", tz="UTC"))

catalog.quote_ticks(start=start, end=end)
```

Finally, clean up the catalog

```python
if os.path.exists(CATALOG_PATH):
    shutil.rmtree(CATALOG_PATH)
```
