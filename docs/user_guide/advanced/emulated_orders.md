# Emulated Orders

The platform makes it possible to emulate most order types locally, regardless
of whether the type is supported on a trading venue. The logic and code paths for 
order emulation are exactly the same for all environment contexts (backtest, sandbox, live), 
and utilize a common `OrderEmulator` component.

```{note}
There is no limitation on the number of emulated orders you can have per running instance.
```

## Submitting for emulation
The only requirement to emulate an order is to pass a `TriggerType` to the `emulation_trigger`
parameter of an `Order` constructor, or `OrderFactory` creation method. The following
emulation trigger types are currently supported:
- `DEFAULT` (which is the same as `BID_ASK`)
- `BID_ASK` (emulated using quote ticks)
- `LAST` (emulated using trade ticks)

Emulated orders are subject to the same risk controls as 'regular' orders, and can be
modified and canceled by a trading strategy in the normal way. They will also be included
when canceling all orders.

```{note}
An emulated order will retain its original client order ID throughout its entire life cycle, making it easy to query through the cache.
```

## Life cycle
An emulated order will progress through the following stages:
- Submitted by a `Strategy` through the `submit_order` method
- Then sent to the `RiskEngine` for pre-trade risk checks (it may be denied at this point)
- Then sent to the `OrderEmulator` where it is _held_ / emulated

### Held emulated orders
The following will occur for an emulated order now _held_ by the `OrderEmulator` component:
- The original `SubmitOrder` command will be cached
- The emulated order will be processed inside a local `MatchingCore` component
- The `OrderEmulator` will subscribe to any needed market data (if not already) to update the matching core
- The emulated order can be modified (by the trader) and updated (by the market) until _released_ or canceled

### Released emulated orders
Once an emulated order is triggered / matched locally based on the arrival of data, the following
_release_ actions will occur:
- The order will be transformed to either a `MARKET` or `LIMIT` order (see below table) through an additional `OrderInitialized` event
- The orders `emulation_trigger` will be set to `NONE` (it will no longer be treated as an emulated order by any component)
- The order attached to the original `SubmitOrder` command will be sent back to the `RiskEngine` for additional checks since any modification/updates
- If not denied, then the command will continue to the `ExecutionEngine` and on to the trading venue via an `ExecutionClient` as normal

The following table lists which order types are possible to emulate, and
which order type they transform to when being released for submission to the 
trading venue.

## Order types
|                        | Can emulate | Released type |
|------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| `MARKET`               | No          | -             |
| `MARKET_TO_LIMIT`      | No          | -             |
| `LIMIT`                | Yes         | `MARKET`      |
| `STOP_MARKET`          | Yes         | `MARKET`      |
| `STOP_LIMIT`           | Yes         | `LIMIT`       |
| `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`    | Yes         | `MARKET`      |
| `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`     | Yes         | `LIMIT`       |
| `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET` | Yes         | `MARKET`      |
| `TRAILING_STOP_LIMIT`  | Yes         | `LIMIT`       |

## Querying
When writing trading strategies, it may be necessary to know the state of emulated orders in the system.
It's possible to query for emulated orders through the following `Cache` methods:
- `self.cache.orders_emulated(...)`
- `self.cache.is_order_emulated(...)`
- `self.cache.orders_emulated_count(...)`

See the full [API reference](../../api_reference/cache) for additional details.

You can also query order objects directly in Python:
- `order.is_emulated`

Or through the C API if in Cython:
- `order.is_emulated_c()`

If either of these return `False`, then the order has been _released_ from the
`OrderEmulator`, and so is no longer considered an emulated order.

```{warning}
It's not advised to hold a local reference to an emulated order, as the order
object will be transformed when/if the emulated order is _released_. You should rely
on the `Cache` which is made for the job.
```

## Persisted emulated orders
If a running system either crashes or shuts down with active emulated orders, then
they will be reloaded inside the `OrderEmulator` from any configured cache database.
It should be remembered that any custom `position_id` originally assigned to the
submit order command will be lost (as per the above warning).
