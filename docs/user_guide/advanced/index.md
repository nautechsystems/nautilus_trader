# Advanced

Welcome to the advanced user guide for the Python/Cython implementation of NautilusTrader!

Here you will find more detailed documentation and examples covering the more advanced
features and functionality of the platform.

You can choose different subjects on the left, which are generally ordered from
highest to lowest level (although they are self-contained and can be read in any order).
