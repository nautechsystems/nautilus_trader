# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for NautilusTrader!

Here you will find detailed documentation and examples explaining the different 
use cases for the platform.

You can choose different subjects from the left nav menu, which are generally ordered from
highest to lowest level (although they are self-contained and can be read in any order).

Since this is a companion guide to the full [API Reference](../api_reference/index.md) 
documentation (which is generated from the latest source code), the API Reference should be considered
the source of truth if code or information in the user guide differs. We will aim to keep the
user guide in line with the API Reference on a best effort basis, and intend to introduce some doc tests
in the near future to assist with this.

```{note}
The terms 'NautilusTrader', 'Nautilus' and 'platform' are used interchageably throughout the documentation.
