# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for NautilusTrader!

Here you will find more in depth guides and tutorials. 

```{note}
The guides are generally ordered from highest to lowest level (although they can also be read in any order).
```

Since the [API Reference](../api_reference/index.md) 
documentation is generated from the latest source code, it should be considered
the source of truth if code in the user guide differs. We will aim to keep the
user guide in line on a best effort basis, and intend to introduce some doc tests
in the near future.
