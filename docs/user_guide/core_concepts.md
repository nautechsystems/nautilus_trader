# Core Concepts

There are two main use cases for this software package:

- Backtesting trading systems on historical data
- Deploying trading systems live in real-time

The projects codebase provides a framework for implementing systems to achieve the above. You will find
the default `backtest` and `live` system implementations in their respectively named subpackages. All examples
will also either utilize the default backtest or live system implementations.

```{note}
We consider trading strategies to be subcomponents of end-to-end trading systems, which
include the application and infrastructure layers.
```

## Distributed
The platform is also able to be become part of an even larger distributed system, and so you will find that 
nearly every configuration and domain object can be serialized over the wire using either JSON, MessagePack, or Apache arrow (feather).

## Common core
Both backtest, sandbox and live trading nodes use a common system core. Registering user defined `Actor` and `Strategy` 
components are then managed in the same way across these environment contexts.

## Backtesting
Backtesting can be achieved by first making data available to a `BacktestEngine` either directly or via
a higher level `BacktestNode` and `DataCatalog`, and then running the system across this data with nanosecond resolution.

## Live trading
A `TradingNode` can ingest data and events from multiple data and execution clients. 
Live deployments can use both demo/paper trading accounts, or real accounts.

For live trading, extremely high performance (benchmarks pending) can be achieved running asynchronously on a single [event loop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html), 
especially leveraging the [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) implementation (available for Linux and macOS only).

## Domain model
A rich trading domain model has been defined, which expresses value types such as
`Price` and `Quantity`, up to more complex entities such as `Order` objects - which aggregate
many events to determine state.

### Data Types
The following market data types can be requested historically, and also subscribed to as live streams when available from a data publisher, and implemented in an integrations adapter.
- `OrderBookDelta`
- `OrderBookDeltas` (L1/L2/L3)
- `OrderBookSnapshot` (L1/L2/L3)
- `QuoteTick`
- `TradeTick`
- `Bar`
- `Instrument`

The following PriceType options can be used for bar aggregations;
- `BID`
- `ASK`
- `MID`
- `LAST`

The following BarAggregation options are possible;
- `MILLISECOND`
- `SECOND`
- `MINUTE`
- `HOUR`
- `DAY`
- `WEEK`
- `MONTH`
- `TICK`
- `VOLUME`
- `VALUE` (a.k.a Dollar bars)
- `TICK_IMBALANCE`
- `TICK_RUNS`
- `VOLUME_IMBALANCE`
- `VOLUME_RUNS`
- `VALUE_IMBALANCE`
- `VALUE_RUNS`

The price types and bar aggregations can be combined with step sizes >= 1 in any way through a `BarSpecification`. 
This enables maximum flexibility and now allows alternative bars to be aggregated for live trading.

### Account Types
The following account types are available for both live and backtest environments;

- `Cash` single-currency (base currency)
- `Cash` multi-currency
- `Margin` single-currency (base currency)
- `Margin` multi-currency

### Order Types
The following order types are available (when possible on an exchange);

- `MARKET`
- `LIMIT`
- `STOP_MARKET`
- `STOP_LIMIT`
- `MARKET_TO_LIMIT`
- `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`
- `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`
- `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET`
- `TRAILING_STOP_LIMIT`
