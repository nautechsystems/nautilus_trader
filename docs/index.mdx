# Every document has a unique id. By default, a document id is the name of the document (without the extension) relative to the root docs directory.

# For example, the ID of greeting.md is greeting, and the ID of guide/hello.md is guide/hello.
# However, the last part of the id can be defined by the user in the front matter. For example, if guide/hello.md's content is defined as below, its final id is guide/part1.

# NautilusTrader Documentation
Welcome to the official documentation for NautilusTrader!

NautilusTrader is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade algorithmic trading platform,

on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

The platform provides an extensive array of features and capabilities, coupled with open-ended flexibility for assembling
trading systems using the framework. Given the breadth of information, and required pre-requisite knowledge, both beginners and experts alike may find the learning curve steep.
