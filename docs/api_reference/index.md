# API Reference

Welcome to the API reference for the Python/Cython implementation of NautilusTrader!

The API reference is automatically generated from the latest NautilusTrader source 
code from the repositories `develop` branch, using [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

```{note}
Given the platforms development is still within an extended **beta** phase, at
a future time we may separate the documentation between the `develop` branch, and
more stable releases on `master`.
