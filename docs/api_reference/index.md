## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straight
forward syntax. It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented
programming language. Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the *de facto lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
