## Why Python?

Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a clean straight
forward syntax. It has since evolved into a fully fledged general purpose object-oriented
programming language. Based on the TIOBE index, Python is currently the most popular programming language in the world.
Not only that, Python has become the _de facto lingua franca_ of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

The language out of the box is not without its drawbacks however, especially in the context of
implementing large performance-critical systems. Cython has addressed a lot of these issues, offering all the advantages
of a statically typed language, embedded into Python's rich ecosystem of software libraries and
developer/user communities.
