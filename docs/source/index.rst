NautilusTrader Documentation
============================

Introduction
------------
Welcome to the documentation for `NautilusTrader`, an open-source, high-performance,
production-grade algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with
the ability to backtest portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical
data with an event-driven engine, and also deploy those same strategies live.

The platform aims to be universal, with any REST/FIX/WebSockets API able to be integrated via modular adapters.
Thus the platform can handle high-frequency trading operations for any asset classes
including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, CFDs and Crypto - across multiple venues simultaneously.

Cython
------
The project heavily utilizes Cython, which provides static type safety and performance through C extension modules.
The libraries can be accessed from both pure Python and Cython.

Cython is a compiled programming language that aims to be a superset of the
Python programming language, designed to give C-like performance with code that
is written mostly in Python with optional additional C-inspired syntax.

Why NautilusTrader?
-------------------
One of the key value propositions of `NautilusTrader` is that it addresses the
challenge of keeping the backtest environment consistent with the production
live trading environment.

Normally research and backtesting may be conducted in
Python (or other suitable language), with trading strategies traditionally then
needing to be reimplemented in C++/C#/Java or other statically typed language(s).
The reasoning here is to enjoy the performance a compiled language can offer,
along with the tooling and support which has made these languages historically
more suitable for large enterprise systems.

The value of `NautilusTrader` here is that this re-implementation step is circumvented, as the
platform was designed from the ground up to hold its own in terms of performance
and quality. Python has simply caught up in performance
(via Cython offering C-level speed) and general tooling, making it a suitable language for implementing
a large system such as this. The benefit here being that a Python native environment
can be offered, suitable for professional quantitative traders and hedge funds.

Why Python?
-----------
Python was originally created decades ago as a simple scripting language with a
clean straight forward syntax. It has since evolved into a fully fledged general
purpose object-oriented programming language.
Not only that, Python has become the `de facto lingua franca` of data science,
machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

The language out of the box is not without its drawbacks however, especially in the context of implementing
large systems. Cython has addressed some of these issues, offering all the advantages
of a statically typed language, embedded into Pythons rich ecosystem of software
libraries and developer/user communities.
