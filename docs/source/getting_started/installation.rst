Installation
============

The ``master`` branch will always reflect the code of the latest release version.

The package is tested against Python 3.7 - 3.9 on 64-bit Windows, macOS and Linux.
We recommend running the platform with the latest stable version of Python, and
in a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies.

For UNIX machines, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is the recommended tool for handling system wide
Python installations and virtual environments.

Installation can be achieved through _one_ of the following options;
