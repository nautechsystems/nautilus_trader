Installation
============

The package is tested against Python versions 3.6.x - 3.8.x on both `Linux` and
`MacOS`. `Windows` support is on the roadmap after a few teething issues are
addressed.

The latest version is available for download via `PyPI`.

.. code-block::

   pip install nautilus_trader

The master branch will always reflect the code of the latest release version.
Also, the documentation found here on `readthedocs` is always current to the
latest version.
