# OKX

:::warning
The OKX integration is still under active development.
:::

Founded in 2017, OKX is a leading cryptocurrency exchange offering spot, perpetual swap,
futures, and options trading. This integration supports live market data ingest and order
execution on OKX.

## Overview

This adapter is implemented in Rust, with optional Python bindings for ease of use in Python-based workflows.
It does not require any external OKX client library dependencies.

:::info
There is **no** need for additional installation steps for `okx`.
The core components of the adapter are compiled as static libraries and automatically linked during the build process.
:::

## Examples

You can find live example scripts [here](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/tree/develop/examples/live/okx/).

| Perpetual Swaps   | ✓         | Linear and inverse contracts.                  |
| Futures           | ✓         | Specific expiration dates.                     |
| Margin            | -         | *Not yet supported*.                           |

The OKX adapter includes multiple components, which can be used separately or together depending on your use case.

- `OKXHttpClient`: Low-level HTTP API connectivity.
- `OKXWebSocketClient`: Low-level WebSocket API connectivity.
- `OKXInstrumentProvider`: Instrument parsing and loading functionality.
- `OKXDataClient`: Market data feed manager.
- `OKXExecutionClient`: Account management and trade execution gateway.
- `OKXLiveDataClientFactory`: Factory for OKX data clients (used by the trading node builder).
- `OKXLiveExecClientFactory`: Factory for OKX execution clients (used by the trading node builder).

:::note
Most users will simply define a configuration for a live trading node (as shown below),
and won’t need to work directly with these lower-level components.

## Symbology

OKX uses native symbols such as `BTC-USDT-SWAP` for linear perpetual swap contracts.
Instruments are identified using the OKX venue-standard format.

## Capability Matrix

Below are the order types, execution instructions, and time-in-force options supported
for linear perpetual swap products on OKX.

## Authentication

To use the OKX adapter, you'll need to create API credentials in your OKX account:

1. Log into your OKX account and navigate to the API management page.
2. Create a new API key with the required permissions for trading and data access.
3. Note down your API key, secret key, and passphrase.

You can provide these credentials through environment variables:

```bash
export OKX_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export OKX_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
export OKX_API_PASSPHRASE="your_passphrase"
```

Or pass them directly in the configuration (not recommended for production).

## Rate limits

The OKX adapter implements automatic rate limiting for both HTTP and WebSocket connections to respect OKX's API limits and prevent rate limit errors.

### HTTP Rate Limiting

The HTTP client implements a conservative rate limit of **250 requests per second**. This limit is based on OKX's documented rate limits:

- Sub-account order limit: 1000 requests per 2 seconds.
- Account balance: 10 requests per 2 seconds.
- Account instruments: 20 requests per 2 seconds.

### WebSocket Rate Limiting

The WebSocket client implements keyed rate limiting with different quotas for different operation types:

- **General operations** (subscriptions): 3 requests per second.
- **Order operations** (place/cancel/amend): 250 requests per second.

This approach ensures that subscription management doesn't interfere with order execution performance while respecting OKX's connection rate limits.

### OKX API Rate Limits

OKX enforces various rate limits on their API endpoints:

- **REST API**: Varies by endpoint (typically 20-1000 requests per 2 seconds depending on the endpoint).
- **WebSocket**: 3 connection requests per second per IP, with subscription and order limits.
- **Trading**: Order placement has specific limits based on account level and instrument type.

For complete and up-to-date rate limit information, refer to the [OKX API documentation](https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/en/#overview-rate-limit).

## Configuration

Below is an example configuration for a live trading node using OKX data and execution clients:

```python
from nautilus_trader.adapters.okx import OKX
from nautilus_trader.adapters.okx import OKXDataClientConfig, OKXExecClientConfig
from nautilus_trader.adapters.okx.factories import OKXLiveDataClientFactory, OKXLiveExecClientFactory
from nautilus_trader.config import InstrumentProviderConfig, LiveExecEngineConfig, LoggingConfig, TradingNodeConfig
from nautilus_trader.live.node import TradingNode

config = TradingNodeConfig(
    ...,
    data_clients={
        OKX: OKXDataClientConfig(
            api_key=None,           # from OKX_API_KEY env var
            api_secret=None,        # from OKX_API_SECRET env var
            api_passphrase=None,    # from OKX_API_PASSPHRASE env var
            base_url_http=None,
            instrument_provider=InstrumentProviderConfig(load_all=True),
            instrument_types=("SWAP",),
            contract_types=None,
            is_demo=False,
        ),
    },
    exec_clients={
        OKX: OKXExecClientConfig(
            api_key=None,
            api_secret=None,
            api_passphrase=None,
            base_url_http=None,
            base_url_ws=None,
            instrument_provider=InstrumentProviderConfig(load_all=True),
            instrument_types=("SWAP",),
            contract_types=None,
            is_demo=False,
        ),
    },
)
node = TradingNode(config=config)
node.add_data_client_factory(OKX, OKXLiveDataClientFactory)
node.add_exec_client_factory(OKX, OKXLiveExecClientFactory)
node.build()
```

## Error handling

Common issues when using the OKX adapter:

- **Authentication errors**: Verify your API credentials and ensure they have the required permissions.
- **Rate limit exceeded**: Reduce request frequency or implement delays between requests.
- **Invalid symbols**: Ensure you're using valid OKX instrument identifiers.
- **Insufficient permissions**: Verify your API key has trading permissions if executing orders.

For detailed error information, check the NautilusTrader logs.
