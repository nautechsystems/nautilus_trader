# BitMEX

Founded in 2014, BitMEX (Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange) is a cryptocurrency derivatives
trading platform offering spot, perpetual contracts, traditional futures, and other
advanced trading products. This integration supports live market data ingest and order
execution with BitMEX.

## Overview

This adapter is implemented in Rust, with optional Python bindings for ease of use in Python-based workflows.
It does not require external BitMEX client libraries—the core components are compiled as a static library and linked automatically during the build.

## Examples

You can find live example scripts [here](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/tree/develop/examples/live/bitmex/).

## Components

This guide assumes a trader is setting up for both live market data feeds, and trade execution.
The BitMEX adapter includes multiple components, which can be used together or separately depending
on the use case.

- `BitmexHttpClient`: Low-level HTTP API connectivity.
- `BitmexWebSocketClient`: Low-level WebSocket API connectivity.
- `BitmexInstrumentProvider`: Instrument parsing and loading functionality.
- `BitmexDataClient`: A market data feed manager.
- `BitmexExecutionClient`: An account management and trade execution gateway.
- `BitmexLiveDataClientFactory`: Factory for BitMEX data clients (used by the trading node builder).
- `BitmexLiveExecClientFactory`: Factory for BitMEX execution clients (used by the trading node builder).

:::note
Most users will simply define a configuration for a live trading node (as below),
and won't need to necessarily work with these lower level components directly.

:::

### Spot trading

- Direct token/coin trading with immediate settlement.
- Major pairs including XBT/USDT, ETH/USDT, ETH/XBT.
- Additional altcoin pairs (LINK, SOL, UNI, APE, AXS, BMEX against USDT).

### Derivatives

- **Perpetual contracts**: Inverse (e.g., XBTUSD) and linear (e.g., ETHUSDT).
- **Traditional futures**: Fixed expiration date contracts.
- **Quanto futures**: Contracts settled in a different currency than the underlying.

## Symbology

BitMEX uses a specific naming convention for its trading symbols. Understanding this
convention is crucial for correctly identifying and trading instruments.

### Symbol format

BitMEX symbols typically follow these patterns:

- **Spot pairs**: Base currency + Quote currency (e.g., `XBT/USDT`, `ETH/USDT`).
- **Perpetual contracts**: Base currency + Quote currency (e.g., `XBTUSD`, `ETHUSD`).
- **Futures contracts**: Base currency + Expiry code (e.g., `XBTM24`, `ETHH25`).
- **Quanto contracts**: Special naming for non-USD settled contracts.

:::info
BitMEX uses `XBT` as the symbol for Bitcoin instead of `BTC`. This follows the ISO 4217
currency code standard where "X" denotes non-national currencies. XBT and BTC refer to
the same asset - Bitcoin.
:::

### Expiry codes

Futures contracts use standard futures month codes:

- `F` = January
- `G` = February
- `H` = March
- `J` = April
- `K` = May
- `M` = June
- `N` = July
- `Q` = August
- `U` = September
- `V` = October
- `X` = November
- `Z` = December

Followed by the year (e.g., `24` for 2024, `25` for 2025).

### NautilusTrader instrument IDs

Within NautilusTrader, BitMEX instruments are identified using the native BitMEX symbol
directly, combined with the venue identifier:

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.identifiers import InstrumentId

# Spot pairs (note: no slash in the symbol)
spot_id = InstrumentId.from_str("XBTUSDT.BITMEX")  # XBT/USDT spot
eth_spot_id = InstrumentId.from_str("ETHUSDT.BITMEX")  # ETH/USDT spot

# Perpetual contracts
perp_id = InstrumentId.from_str("XBTUSD.BITMEX")  # Bitcoin perpetual (inverse)
linear_perp_id = InstrumentId.from_str("ETHUSDT.BITMEX")  # Ethereum perpetual (linear)

# Futures contract (June 2024)
futures_id = InstrumentId.from_str("XBTM24.BITMEX")  # Bitcoin futures expiring June 2024
```

:::note
BitMEX spot symbols in NautilusTrader don't include the slash (/) that appears in the
BitMEX UI. Use `XBTUSDT` instead of `XBT/USDT`.
:::

### Quantity scaling

BitMEX reports spot and derivative quantities in *contract* units. The actual asset size per
contract is exchange-specific and published on the instrument definition:

- `lotSize` – minimum number of contracts you can trade.
- `underlyingToPositionMultiplier` – number of contracts per unit of the underlying asset.

For example, the SOL/USDT spot instrument (`SOLUSDT`) exposes `lotSize = 1000` and
`underlyingToPositionMultiplier = 10000`, meaning one contract represents `1 / 10000 = 0.0001`
SOL, and the minimum order (`lotSize * contract_size`) is `0.1` SOL. The adapter now derives the
contract size directly from these fields and scales both inbound market data and outbound orders
accordingly, so quantities in Nautilus are always expressed in base units (SOL, ETH, etc.).

See the BitMEX API documentation for details on these fields: <https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiOverview#Instrument-Properties>.

## Orders capability

The BitMEX integration supports the following order types and execution features.

### Order types

| Order Type             | Supported | Notes                                         |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `MARKET`               | ✓         | Executed immediately at current market price. Quote quantity not supported. |
| `LIMIT`                | ✓         | Executed only at specified price or better.   |
| `STOP_MARKET`          | ✓         | Supported (set `trigger_price`).              |
| `STOP_LIMIT`           | ✓         | Supported (set `price` and `trigger_price`).  |
| `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`    | ✓         | Supported (set `trigger_price`).              |
| `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`     | ✓         | Supported (set `price` and `trigger_price`).  |
| `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET` | -         | *Not implemented* (supported by BitMEX).      |

### Execution instructions

| Instruction   | Supported | Notes                                                                             |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `post_only`   | ✓         | Supported via `ParticipateDoNotInitiate` execution instruction on `LIMIT` orders. |
| `reduce_only` | ✓         | Supported via `ReduceOnly` execution instruction.                                 |

:::note
Post-only orders that would cross the spread are canceled by BitMEX rather than rejected. The
integration surfaces these as rejections with `due_post_only=True` so strategies can handle them
consistently.
:::

### Trigger types

BitMEX supports multiple reference prices to evaluate stop/conditional order triggers for:

- `STOP_MARKET`
- `STOP_LIMIT`
- `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`
- `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`

Choose the trigger type that matches your strategy and/or risk preferences.

| Reference price | Nautilus `TriggerType` | BitMEX value  | Notes                                                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Last trade      | `LAST_PRICE`           | `LastPrice`   | BitMEX default; triggers on the last traded price.                              |
| Mark price      | `MARK_PRICE`           | `MarkPrice`   | Recommended for many stop-loss use cases to reduce stop-outs from price spikes. |
| Index price     | `INDEX_PRICE`          | `IndexPrice`  | Tracks the external index; useful for some contracts.                           |

- If no `trigger_type` is provided, BitMEX uses its venue default (`LastPrice`).
- These trigger references are exchange-evaluated; the order remains resting at the venue until triggered.

**Example**:

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType

order = self.order_factory.stop_market(
    instrument_id=instrument_id,
    order_side=order_side,
    quantity=qty,
    trigger_price=trigger,
    trigger_type=TriggerType.MARK_PRICE,  # Use BitMEX Mark Price as reference
)
```

`ExecTester` example configuration also demonstrates setting `stop_trigger_type=TriggerType.MARK_PRICE`
in `examples/live/bitmex/bitmex_exec_tester.py`.

### Time in force

| Time in force  | Supported | Notes                                               |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `GTC`          | ✓         | Good Till Canceled (default).                       |
| `GTD`          | -         | *Not supported by BitMEX*.                          |
| `FOK`          | ✓         | Fill or Kill - fills entire order or cancels.       |
| `IOC`          | ✓         | Immediate or Cancel - partial fill allowed.         |
| `DAY`          | ✓         | Expires at 00:00 UTC (BitMEX trading day boundary). |

:::note
`DAY` orders expire at 12:00am UTC, which marks the BitMEX trading day boundary (end of trading hours for that day).
See the [BitMEX Exchange Rules](https://www.bitmex.com/exchange-rules) and [API documentation](https://www.bitmex.com/api/explorer/) for complete details.

## Market data

- Order book deltas: `L2_MBP` only; `depth` 0 (full book) or 25.
- Order book snapshots: `L2_MBP` only; `depth` 0 (default 10) or 10.
- Quotes, trades, and instrument updates are supported via WebSocket.
- Funding rates, mark prices, and index prices are supported where applicable.
- Historical requests via REST:
  - Trade ticks with optional `start`, `end`, and `limit` filters (up to 1,000 results per call).
  - Time bars (`1m`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d`) for externally aggregated LAST prices, including optional partial bins.

:::note
BitMEX caps each REST response at 1,000 rows and requires manual pagination via `start`/`startTime`. The current adapter returns only the
first page; wider pagination support is scheduled for a future update.
:::

## Connection management

### HTTP Keep-Alive

The BitMEX adapter utilizes HTTP keep-alive for optimal performance:

- **Connection pooling**: Connections are automatically pooled and reused.
- **Keep-alive timeout**: 90 seconds (matches BitMEX server-side timeout).
- **Automatic reconnection**: Failed connections are automatically re-established.
- **SSL session caching**: Reduces handshake overhead for subsequent requests.

This configuration ensures low-latency communication with BitMEX servers by maintaining
persistent connections and avoiding the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.

### Request authentication and expiration

BitMEX uses an `api-expires` header for request authentication to prevent replay attacks:

- Each signed request includes a Unix timestamp (in seconds) indicating when it expires.
- The timestamp is calculated as: `current_timestamp + (recv_window_ms / 1000)`.
- BitMEX rejects requests where the `api-expires` timestamp has already passed.

#### Configuring the expiration window

The expiration window is controlled by the `recv_window_ms` configuration parameter (default: 10000ms = 10 seconds):

```python
from nautilus_trader.adapters.bitmex.config import BitmexExecClientConfig

config = BitmexExecClientConfig(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_secret="YOUR_API_SECRET",
    recv_window_ms=30000,  # 30 seconds for high-latency networks
)
```

**When to adjust this value:**

- **Default (10s)**: Sufficient for most deployments with accurate system clocks and low network latency.
- **Increase (20-30s)**: If you experience "request has expired" errors due to:
  - Clock skew between your system and BitMEX servers.
  - High network latency or packet loss.
  - Requests queued due to rate limiting.
- **Decrease (5s)**: For tighter security in low-latency, time-synchronized environments.

**Important considerations:**

- **Milliseconds to seconds**: Specified in milliseconds for consistency with other adapters, but converted to seconds via integer division (`recv_window_ms / 1000`) since BitMEX uses seconds-granularity timestamps.
- Larger windows increase tolerance for timing issues but widen the replay attack window.
- Ensure your system clock is synchronized with NTP to minimize clock drift.
- Network latency and processing time consume part of the window.

## Rate limiting

BitMEX implements a dual-layer rate limiting system:

### REST limits

- **Burst limit**: 10 requests per second for authenticated users (applies to order placement, modification, and cancel endpoints).
- **Rolling minute limit**: 120 requests per minute for authenticated users (30 requests per minute for unauthenticated users).
- **Order caps**: 200 open orders and 10 stop orders per symbol; exceeding these caps triggers exchange-side rejections.

The adapter enforces these quotas automatically and surfaces the rate-limit headers BitMEX returns with each response.

### WebSocket limits

- Connection requests: follow the exchange guidance (currently 3 connections per second per IP).
- Private streams require authentication; the adapter reconnects automatically if a limit is exceeded.

:::warning
Exceeding BitMEX rate limits returns HTTP 429 and may trigger temporary IP bans; persistent 4xx/5xx errors can extend the lockout period.
:::

| Key / Endpoint                    | Limit (req/sec) | Additional quota              | Notes                                    |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `bitmex:global`                   | 10              | `bitmex:minute` = 120 req/min | Burst limit for authenticated users.     |
| `/api/v1/order`                   | 10              | `/api/v1/order:minute` = 60   | Mirrors BitMEX per-user allowances.      |
| `/api/v1/order/bulk`              | 5               | –                             | Batch operations throttled tighter.      |
| `/api/v1/order/cancelAll`         | 2               | –                             | Cancel all orders.                       |

All requests automatically consume both the global burst bucket and the rolling minute bucket. Endpoints that have their own minute quota (e.g. `/api/v1/order`) also queue against that per-route key, so repeated calls with different parameters still share a single rate bucket.

:::info
For more details on rate limiting, see the [BitMEX API documentation on rate limits](https://www.bitmex.com/app/restAPI#Limits).
:::

### Rate-limit headers

BitMEX exposes the current allowance via response headers:

- `x-ratelimit-limit`: total requests permitted in the current window.
- `x-ratelimit-remaining`: remaining requests before throttling occurs.
- `x-ratelimit-reset`: UNIX timestamp when the allowance resets.
- `retry-after`: seconds to wait after a 429 response.

## Configuration

### API credentials

BitMEX API credentials can be provided either directly in the configuration or via environment variables:

- `BITMEX_API_KEY`: Your BitMEX API key for production.
- `BITMEX_API_SECRET`: Your BitMEX API secret for production.
- `BITMEX_TESTNET_API_KEY`: Your BitMEX API key for testnet (when `testnet=True`).
- `BITMEX_TESTNET_API_SECRET`: Your BitMEX API secret for testnet (when `testnet=True`).

To generate API keys:

1. Log in to your BitMEX account.
2. Navigate to Account & Security → API Keys.
3. Create a new API key with appropriate permissions.
4. For testnet, use [testnet.bitmex.com](https://testnet.bitmex.com).

:::note
**Testnet API endpoints**:

- REST API: `https://testnet.bitmex.com/api/v1`
- WebSocket: `wss://ws.testnet.bitmex.com/realtime`

The adapter automatically routes requests to the correct endpoints when `testnet=True` is configured.
:::

### Configuration examples

A typical BitMEX configuration for live trading includes both testnet and mainnet options:

```python
from nautilus_trader.adapters.bitmex.config import BitmexDataClientConfig
from nautilus_trader.adapters.bitmex.config import BitmexExecClientConfig

# Using environment variables (recommended)
testnet_data_config = BitmexDataClientConfig(
    testnet=True,  # API credentials loaded from BITMEX_API_KEY and BITMEX_API_SECRET
)

# Using explicit credentials
mainnet_data_config = BitmexDataClientConfig(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",  # Or use os.getenv("BITMEX_API_KEY")
    api_secret="YOUR_API_SECRET",  # Or use os.getenv("BITMEX_API_SECRET")
    testnet=False,
)

mainnet_exec_config = BitmexExecClientConfig(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    api_secret="YOUR_API_SECRET",
    testnet=False,
)
```

## Trading considerations

### Contingent orders

The BitMEX execution adapter now maps Nautilus contingent order lists to the exchange's
native `clOrdLinkID`/`contingencyType` mechanics. When the engine submits
`ContingencyType::Oco` or `ContingencyType::Oto` orders the adapter will:

- Create/maintain the linked order group on BitMEX so child stops and targets inherit the
  parent order status.
- Propagate order list updates and cancellations so that contingent peers stay aligned with
  the current position state.
- Surface execution reports with the appropriate contingency metadata, enabling strategy-level
  tracking without additional manual wiring.

This means common bracket flows (entry + stop + take-profit) and multi-leg stop structures can
now be managed directly by BitMEX instead of being emulated client-side. When defining
strategies, continue to use Nautilus `OrderList`/`ContingencyType` abstractions—the adapter
handles the required BitMEX wiring automatically.

### Contract specifications

- **Inverse contracts**: Settled in cryptocurrency (e.g., XBTUSD settled in XBT).
- **Linear contracts**: Settled in stablecoin (e.g., ETHUSDT settled in USDT).
- **Contract size**: Varies by instrument, check specifications carefully.
- **Tick size**: Minimum price increment varies by contract.

### Margin requirements
