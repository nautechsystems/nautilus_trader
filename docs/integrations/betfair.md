# Betfair

Founded in 2000, Betfair operates the worldâ€™s largest online betting exchange,
with its headquarters in London and satellite offices across the globe.

NautilusTrader provides an adapter for integrating with the Betfair REST API and
Exchange Streaming API.

## Installation

To install the latest `nautilus_trader` package along with the `betfair` dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -U "nautilus_trader[betfair]"
```

To install from source using poetry:

```
poetry install --extras betfair
```

## Examples

You can find working live example scripts [here](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/tree/develop/examples/live/betfair/).

## Betfair documentation

Betfair provides extensive [documentation](https://developer.betfair.com/en/get-started/) for developers integrating with their exchange APIs.
This resource is valuable for gaining background information, understanding the APIs, and troubleshooting integration issues.

## Application Keys

Betfair uses Application Keys (App keys) to manage interactions with its APIs.
Initially, you will be given a "Delayed" App key (data delayed 1-180 seconds), later you can apply for a "Live" App key.

After setting up a funded Betfair account, you will need to obtain your App key.
You can do this through the [Accounts API Demo Tool](https://apps.betfair.com/visualisers/api-ng-account-operations/). Follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Betfair account. With your browser's developer tools open, inspect the initial POST request to https://identitysso.betfair.com.au/api/login, and find the `ssoid` in the response headers (set in the cookie).
2. Open the Betfair API tool and enter your `ssoid` into the Session Token (ssoid) field.
3. In the left-hand navigation, select `getDeveloperAppKeys`, then click the Execute button at the bottom to retrieve your App key.

## API credentials

There are two options for supplying your credentials to the Betfair clients.
Either pass the corresponding values to the config dictionaries, or
set the following environment variables:
- `BETFAIR_USERNAME`
- `BETFAIR_PASSWORD`
- `BETFAIR_APP_KEY`
- `BETFAIR_CERT_DIR`

When starting the trading node, you'll receive immediate confirmation of whether your
credentials are valid and have trading permissions.

:::tip
Best practice is to manage your credentials using environment variables.

## Overview

The following adapter classes are available:
- `BetfairInstrumentProvider` which enables querying the Betfair market catalogue for betting markets, which are then converted into Nautilus "instruments".
- `BetfairDataClient` which connects to the Exchange Stream API and streams market data.
- `BetfairExecutionClient` which enables the retrieval of account information and execution and updates for orders (or bets).

## Configuration

The most common use case is to configure a live `TradingNode` to include Betfair
data and execution clients. To achieve this, add a `BETFAIR` section to your client
configuration(s):

```python
from nautilus_trader.config import TradingNodeConfig

config = TradingNodeConfig(
    ...,  # Omitted 
    data_clients={
        "BETFAIR": {
            # username=None, # 'BETFAIR_USERNAME' env var
            # password=None, # 'BETFAIR_PASSWORD' env var
            # app_key=None, # 'BETFAIR_APP_KEY' env var
            # cert_dir=None, # 'BETFAIR_CERT_DIR' env var
        },
    },
    exec_clients={
        "BETFAIR": {
            # username=None, # 'BETFAIR_USERNAME' env var
            # password=None, # 'BETFAIR_PASSWORD' env var
            # app_key=None, # 'BETFAIR_APP_KEY' env var
            # cert_dir=None, # 'BETFAIR_CERT_DIR' env var
            "base_currency": "AUD",
        },
    }
)
```

Then, create a `TradingNode` and add the client factories:

```python
from nautilus_trader.adapters.betfair.factories import BetfairLiveDataClientFactory
from nautilus_trader.adapters.betfair.factories import BetfairLiveExecClientFactory
from nautilus_trader.live.node import TradingNode

# Instantiate the live trading node with a configuration
node = TradingNode(config=config)

# Register the client factories with the node
node.add_data_client_factory("BETFAIR", BetfairLiveDataClientFactory)
node.add_exec_client_factory("BETFAIR", BetfairLiveExecClientFactory)

# Finally build the node
node.build()
```
