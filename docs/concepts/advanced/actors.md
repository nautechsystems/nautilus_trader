# Actors

The `Strategy` class actually inherits from `Actor`, and additionally provides order management
methods on top. This means everything discussed in the [Strategies](../strategies.md) guide
also applies to actors.

This doc is an evolving work in progress and will continue to describe actors more fullyâ€¦
