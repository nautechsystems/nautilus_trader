# Positions

We are currently working on this concept guide.

This guide explains how positions work in NautilusTrader, including their lifecycle, aggregation
from order fills, profit and loss calculations, and the important concept of position snapshotting
for netting OMS configurations.

## Overview

A position represents an open exposure to a particular instrument in the market. Positions are
fundamental to tracking trading performance and risk, as they aggregate all fills for a particular
instrument and continuously calculate metrics like unrealized PnL, average entry price, and total
exposure.

The system automatically creates positions when orders fill and tracks them
from open to close. The platform supports both netting
and hedging position management styles through its OMS (Order Management System) configuration.

## Position lifecycle

### Creation

The system opens a position on the first fill:

- **NETTING OMS**: Opens on first fill for an instrument (one position per instrument).
- **HEDGING OMS**: Opens on first fill for a new `position_id` (multiple positions per instrument).

A position tracks:

- Opening order and fill details.
- Entry side (`LONG` or `SHORT`).
- Initial quantity and average price.
- Timestamps for initialization and opening.

:::tip
You can access positions through the Cache using `self.cache.position(position_id)` or
`self.cache.positions(instrument_id=instrument_id)` from within your actors/strategies.
:::

### Updates

As additional fills occur, the position:

- Aggregates quantities from buy and sell fills.
- Recalculates average entry and exit prices.
- Updates peak quantity (maximum exposure reached).
- Tracks all associated order IDs and trade IDs.
- Accumulates commissions by currency.

### Closure

A position closes when the net quantity becomes zero (`FLAT`). At closure:

- The closing order ID is recorded.
- Duration is calculated from open to close.
- Final realized PnL is computed.
- In `NETTING` OMS, the engine preserves closed position state through snapshots to maintain historical PnL (see [Position snapshotting](#position-snapshotting)).

## Order fill aggregation

Positions aggregate order fills to maintain an accurate view of market exposure. The aggregation
process handles both sides of trading activity:

### Buy fills

When a BUY order fills:

- Increases long exposure or reduces short exposure.
- Updates average entry price for opening trades.
- Updates average exit price for closing trades.
- Calculates realized PnL for any closed portion.

### Sell fills

When a SELL order fills:

- Increases short exposure or reduces long exposure.
- Updates average entry price for opening trades.
- Updates average exit price for closing trades.
- Calculates realized PnL for any closed portion.

### Net position calculation

The position maintains a `signed_qty` field representing the net exposure:

- Positive values indicate `LONG` positions.
- Negative values indicate `SHORT` positions.
- Zero indicates a `FLAT` (closed) position.

```python
# Example: Position aggregation
# Initial BUY 100 units at $50
signed_qty = +100  # LONG position

# Subsequent SELL 150 units at $55
signed_qty = -50   # Now SHORT position

# Final BUY 50 units at $52
signed_qty = 0     # Position FLAT (closed)
```

## OMS types and position management

NautilusTrader supports two primary OMS types that fundamentally affect how positions are tracked
and managed. An `OmsType.UNSPECIFIED` option also exists, which defaults to the component's
context. For comprehensive details, see the [Execution guide](execution.md#order-management-system-oms).

### `NETTING`

In `NETTING` mode, all fills for an instrument are aggregated into a single position:

- One position per instrument ID.
- All fills contribute to the same position.
- Position flips from `LONG` to `SHORT` (or vice versa) as net quantity changes.
- Historical snapshots preserve closed position states.

### `HEDGING`

In `HEDGING` mode, multiple positions can exist for the same instrument:

- Multiple simultaneous `LONG` and `SHORT` positions.
- Each position has a unique position ID.
- Positions are tracked independently.
- No automatic netting across positions.

:::warning
When using `HEDGING` mode, be aware of increased margin requirements as each position
consumes margin independently. Some venues may not support true hedging mode and will
net positions automatically.
:::

### Strategy vs venue OMS

The platform allows different OMS configurations for strategies and venues:

| Strategy OMS | Venue OMS | Behavior                                                    |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NETTING`    | `NETTING` | Single position per instrument at both strategy and venue.  |
| `HEDGING`    | `HEDGING` | Multiple positions supported at both levels.                |
| `NETTING`    | `HEDGING` | Venue tracks multiple, Nautilus maintains single position.  |
| `HEDGING`    | `NETTING` | Venue tracks single, Nautilus maintains virtual positions.  |

:::tip
For most trading scenarios, keeping strategy and venue OMS types aligned simplifies
position management. Override configurations are primarily useful for prop trading
desks or when interfacing with legacy systems. See the [Live guide](live.md)
for venue-specific OMS configuration.
:::

## Position snapshotting

Position snapshotting is an important feature for `NETTING` OMS configurations that preserves
the state of closed positions for accurate PnL tracking and reporting.

### Why snapshotting matters

In a `NETTING` system, when a position closes (becomes `FLAT`) and then reopens with a new trade,
the position object is reset to track the new exposure. Without snapshotting, the historical
realized PnL from the previous position cycle would be lost.

### How it works

When a `NETTING` position closes and then receives a new fill for the same instrument, the execution
engine snapshots the closed position state before resetting it, preserving:

- Final quantities and prices.
- Realized PnL.
- All fill events.
- Commission totals.

This snapshot is stored in the cache indexed by position ID. The position then resets for the new
cycle while previous snapshots remain accessible. The Portfolio aggregates PnL across all snapshots
for accurate totals.

:::note
This historical snapshot mechanism differs from optional position state snapshots (`snapshot_positions`),
which periodically record open-position state for telemetry. See the [Live guide](live.md) for
`snapshot_positions` and `snapshot_positions_interval_secs` settings.
:::

### Example scenario

```python
# NETTING OMS Example
# Cycle 1: Open LONG position
BUY 100 units at $50   # Position opens
SELL 100 units at $55  # Position closes, PnL = $500
# Snapshot taken preserving $500 realized PnL

# Cycle 2: Open SHORT position
SELL 50 units at $54   # Position reopens (SHORT)
BUY 50 units at $52    # Position closes, PnL = $100
# Snapshot taken preserving $100 realized PnL

# Total realized PnL = $500 + $100 = $600 (from snapshots)
```

Without snapshotting, only the most recent cycle's PnL would be available, leading to
incorrect reporting and analysis.

## PnL calculations

NautilusTrader provides comprehensive PnL calculations that account for instrument
specifications and market conventions.

### Realized PnL

Calculated when positions are partially or fully closed:

```python
# For standard instruments
realized_pnl = (exit_price - entry_price) * closed_quantity * multiplier

# For inverse instruments (side-aware)
# LONG: realized_pnl = closed_quantity * multiplier * (1/entry_price - 1/exit_price)
# SHORT: realized_pnl = closed_quantity * multiplier * (1/exit_price - 1/entry_price)
```

The engine automatically applies the correct formula based on position side.

### Unrealized PnL

Calculated using current market prices for open positions. The `price` parameter accepts any
reference price (bid, ask, mid, last, or mark):

```python
position.unrealized_pnl(last_price)  # Using last traded price
position.unrealized_pnl(bid_price)   # Conservative for LONG positions
position.unrealized_pnl(ask_price)   # Conservative for SHORT positions
```

### Total PnL

Combines realized and unrealized components:

```python
total_pnl = position.total_pnl(current_price)
# Returns realized_pnl + unrealized_pnl
```

### Currency considerations

- PnL is calculated in the instrument's settlement currency.
- For Forex, this is typically the quote currency.
- For inverse contracts, PnL may be in the base currency.
- Portfolio aggregates realized PnL per instrument in settlement currency.
- Multi-currency totals require conversion outside the Position class.

## Commissions and costs

Positions track all trading costs:

- Commissions are accumulated by currency.
- Each fill's commission is added to the running total.
- Multiple commission currencies are supported.
- Realized PnL includes commissions only when denominated in the settlement currency.
- Other commissions are tracked separately and may require conversion.

```python
commissions = position.commissions()
# Returns list[Money] with aggregated commission totals per currency

notional = position.notional_value(current_price)
# Returns Money in quote currency (standard) or base currency (inverse)
```

**Limitations:**

- Panics if inverse instrument has no `base_currency` set.
- Does not handle quanto contracts (returns quote currency instead of settlement currency).
- For quanto instruments, use `instrument.calculate_notional_value()` instead.

[API Reference](../api_reference/model/position.md#class-position).
:::

## Events and tracking

Positions maintain a complete history of events:

- All order fill events are stored chronologically.
- Associated client order IDs are tracked.
- Trade IDs from the venue are preserved.
- Event count indicates total fills applied.

This historical data enables:

- Detailed position analysis.
- Trade reconciliation.
- Performance attribution.
- Audit trails.

:::tip
Use `position.events` to access the full history of fills for reconciliation.
The `position.trade_ids` property helps match against broker statements.
See the [Execution guide](execution.md) for reconciliation best practices.
:::

## Numerical precision

Position calculations use 64-bit floating-point (`f64`) arithmetic for PnL and average price computations.
While fixed-point types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`) preserve exact precision at configured decimal places,
internal calculations convert to `f64` for performance and overflow safety.

### Design rationale

The platform uses `f64` for position calculations to balance performance and accuracy:

- Floating-point operations are significantly faster than arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
- Raw integer multiplication can overflow even with 128-bit integers.
- Each calculation starts from precise fixed-point values, avoiding cumulative error.
- IEEE-754 double precision provides ~15 decimal digits of accuracy.

### Validated precision characteristics

Testing confirms `f64` arithmetic maintains accuracy for typical trading scenarios:

- Standard amounts: No precision loss for amounts ≥ 0.01 in standard currencies.
- High-precision instruments: 9-decimal crypto prices preserved within 1e-6 tolerance.
- Sequential fills: 100 fills show no drift (commission accuracy to 1e-10).
- Extreme prices: Handles range from 0.00001 to 99,999.99999 without overflow.
- Round-trip trades: Opening and closing at same price produces exact PnL (commissions only).

For implementation details, see `test_position_pnl_precision_*` tests in `crates/model/src/position.rs`.

:::note
For regulatory compliance or audit trails requiring exact decimal arithmetic, consider using `Decimal`
types from external libraries. Very small amounts below `f64` epsilon (~1e-15) may round to zero,
though this does not affect realistic trading scenarios with standard currency precisions.

## Integration with other components

Positions interact with several key components:

- **Portfolio**: Aggregates positions across instruments and strategies.
- **ExecutionEngine**: Creates and updates positions from fills.
- **Cache**: Stores position state and snapshots.
- **RiskEngine**: Monitors position limits and exposure.

:::note
Positions are not created for spread instruments. While contingent orders can still trigger for spreads,
they operate without position linkage. The engine handles spread instruments separately from regular positions.
:::

## Summary

Positions are central to tracking trading activity and performance in NautilusTrader. Understanding
how positions aggregate fills, calculate PnL, and handle different OMS configurations is essential
for building robust trading strategies. The position snapshotting mechanism ensures accurate
historical tracking in `NETTING` mode, while the comprehensive event history supports detailed
analysis and reconciliation.
