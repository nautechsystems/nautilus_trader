# Logging

The platform provides logging for both backtesting and live trading using a high-performance logger implemented in Rust.
The logger operates in a separate thread and uses a multi-producer single consumer (MPSC) channel to receive log messages.
This design ensures that the main thread is not blocked by log string formatting or file I/O operations.

```{note}
The latest stable Rust MPSC channel is used, which is now based on the `crossbeam` implementation.
```

There are two configurable writers for logging:
- stdout/stderr writer
- log file writer

Infrastructure such as [vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector) can be configured to collect these log events.

## Configuration

Logging can be configured by importing the `LoggingConfig` object.
By default, log events with an 'INFO' `LogLevel` and higher are written to stdout/stderr.

Log level (`LogLevel`) values include:
- 'DEBUG' or 'DBG'
- 'INFO' or 'INF'
- 'WARNING' or 'WRN'
- 'ERROR' or 'ERR'

```{tip}
See the `LoggingConfig` [API Reference](../api_reference/config.md) for further details.
```

Logging can be configured in the following ways:
- Minimum `LogLevel` for stdout/stderr
- Minimum `LogLevel` for log files
- Automatic log file naming and daily rotation, or custom log file name
- Plain text or JSON log file formatting
- Bypass logging completely

### Standard output logging
Log messages are written to the console via stdout/stderr writers. The minimum log level can be configured using the `log_level` parameter.

### File logging

Log files are written to the current working directory with daily rotation (UTC) by default. 

The default naming convention is as follows:
- Trader ID
- ISO 8601 datetime
- Instance ID
- The log format suffix

```
{trader_id}_{%Y-%m-%d}_{instance_id}.{log | json}`
```

e.g. `TESTER-001_2023-03-23_635a4539-4fe2-4cb1-9be3-3079ba8d879e.json`

You can specify a custom log directory path using the `log_directory` parameter and/or a custom log file basename using the `log_file_name` parameter. 
The log files will always be suffixed with '.log' for plain text, or '.json' for JSON (no need to include a suffix in file names).

If the log file already exists, it will be appended to.

### Component filtering

The `log_component_levels` parameter can be used to set log levels for each component individually.
The input value should be a dictionary of component ID strings to log level strings: `dict[str, str]`.

Below is an example of a trading node logging configuration that includes some of the options mentioned above:

```python
config_node = TradingNodeConfig(
    trader_id="TESTER-001",
    logging=LoggingConfig(
        log_level="INFO",
        log_level_file="DEBUG",
        log_file_format="json",
        log_component_levels={ "Portfolio": "INFO" },
    ),
    ... # Omitted
)
```

For backtesting, the `BacktestEngineConfig` class can be used instead of `TradingNodeConfig`, as the same options are available.
