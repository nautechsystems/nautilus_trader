# Logging

The platform provides logging for both backtesting and live trading using a high-performance logging system implemented in Rust
with a standardized facade from the `log` crate.

The core logger operates in a separate thread and uses a multi-producer single-consumer (MPSC) channel to receive log messages.
This design ensures that the main thread remains performant, avoiding potential bottlenecks caused by log string formatting or file I/O operations.

Logging output is configurable and supports:
- **stdout/stderr writer** for console output
- **file writer** for persistent storage of logs

:::info
Infrastructure such as [Vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector) can be integrated to collect and aggregate events within your system.
:::

## Configuration

Logging can be configured by importing the `LoggingConfig` object.
By default, log events with an 'INFO' `LogLevel` and higher are written to stdout/stderr.

Log level (`LogLevel`) values include (and generally match Rusts `tracing` level filters):
- `OFF`
- `DEBUG`
- `INFO`
- `WARNING` or `WARN`
- `ERROR`

:::info
See the `LoggingConfig` [API Reference](../api_reference/config.md) for further details.
:::

Logging can be configured in the following ways:
- Minimum `LogLevel` for stdout/stderr
- Minimum `LogLevel` for log files
- Automatic log file naming and daily rotation, or custom log file name
- Directory for writing log files
- Plain text or JSON log file formatting
- Filtering of individual components by log level
- ANSI colors in log lines
- Bypass logging entirely
- Print Rust config to stdout at initialization

### Standard output logging
Log messages are written to the console via stdout/stderr writers. The minimum log level can be configured using the `log_level` parameter.

### File logging

Log files are written to the current working directory with daily rotation (UTC) by default. 

The default naming convention is as follows:
- Trader ID
- ISO 8601 datetime
- Instance ID
- The log format suffix

```
{trader_id}_{%Y-%m-%d}_{instance_id}.{log | json}`
```

e.g. `TESTER-001_2023-03-23_635a4539-4fe2-4cb1-9be3-3079ba8d879e.json`

You can specify a custom log directory path using the `log_directory` parameter and/or a custom log file basename using the `log_file_name` parameter. 
The log files will always be suffixed with '.log' for plain text, or '.json' for JSON (no need to include a suffix in file names).

If the log file already exists, it will be appended to.

### Component log filtering

The `log_component_levels` parameter can be used to set log levels for each component individually.
The input value should be a dictionary of component ID strings to log level strings: `dict[str, str]`.

Below is an example of a trading node logging configuration that includes some of the options mentioned above:

```python
from nautilus_trader.config import LoggingConfig
from nautilus_trader.config import TradingNodeConfig

config_node = TradingNodeConfig(
    trader_id="TESTER-001",
    logging=LoggingConfig(
        log_level="INFO",
        log_level_file="DEBUG",
        log_file_format="json",
        log_component_levels={ "Portfolio": "INFO" },
    ),
    ... # Omitted
)
```

For backtesting, the `BacktestEngineConfig` class can be used instead of `TradingNodeConfig`, as the same options are available.

### Log Colors

ANSI color codes are utilized to enhance the readability of logs when viewed in a terminal.
These color codes can make it easier to distinguish different parts of log messages.
In environments that do not support ANSI color rendering (such as some cloud environments or text editors),
these color codes may not be appropriate as they can appear as raw text.

To accommodate for such scenarios, the `LoggingConfig.log_colors` option can be set to `false`.
Disabling `log_colors` will prevent the addition of ANSI color codes to the log messages, ensuring
compatibility across different environments where color rendering is not supported.

## Using a Logger directly

It's possible to use `Logger` objects directly, and these can be initialized anywhere (very similar to the Python built-in `logging` API).

If you ***aren't*** using an object which already initializes a `NautilusKernel` (and logging) such as `BacktestEngine` or `TradingNode`, 
then you can activate logging in the following way:
```python
from nautilus_trader.common.component import init_logging
from nautilus_trader.common.component import Logger

log_guard = init_logging()
logger = Logger("MyLogger")
```

:::info
See the `init_logging` [API Reference](../api_reference/common) for further details.
:::

:::warning
Only one logging system can be initialized per process with an `init_logging` call, and the `LogGuard` which is returned must be kept alive for the lifetime of the program.
:::

## LogGuard: Managing log lifecycle

The `LogGuard` ensures that the logging system remains active and operational throughout the lifecycle of a process.
It prevents premature shutdown of the logging system when running multiple engines in the same process.

### Why use LogGuard?

Without a `LogGuard`, any attempt to run sequential engines in the same process may result in errors such as:

```
Error sending log event: [INFO] ...
```

This occurs because the logging system's underlying channel and Rust `Logger` are closed when the first engine is disposed.
As a result, subsequent engines lose access to the logging system, leading to these errors.

By leveraging a `LogGuard`, you can ensure robust logging behavior across multiple backtests or engine runs in the same process.
The `LogGuard` retains the resources of the logging system and ensures that logs continue to function correctly,
even as engines are disposed and initialized.

:::note
Using `LogGuard` is critical to maintain consistent logging behavior throughout a process with multiple engines.
:::

## Running multiple engines

The following example demonstrates how to use a `LogGuard` when running multiple engines sequentially in the same process:

```{python}
log_guard = None  # Initialize LogGuard reference

for i in range(number_of_backtests):
    engine = setup_engine(...)

    # Assign reference to LogGuard
    if log_guard is None:
        log_guard = engine.get_log_guard()

    # Add actors and execute the engine
    actors = setup_actors(...)
    engine.add_actors(actors)
    engine.run()
    engine.dispose()  # Dispose safely
```

### Key steps

- **Initialize LogGuard once**: The `LogGuard` is obtained from the first engine (`engine.get_log_guard()`) and is retained throughout the process. This ensures that the logging system remains active.
- **Dispose engines safely**: Each engine is safely disposed of after its backtest completes, without affecting the logging system.
- **Reuse LogGuard**: The same `LogGuard` instance is reused for subsequent engines, preventing the logging system from shutting down prematurely.

### Considerations

- **Single LogGuard per process**: Only one `LogGuard` can be used per process.
- **Thread safety**: The logging system, including `LogGuard`, is thread-safe, ensuring consistent behavior even in multi-threaded environments.
- **Flush logs on termination**: Always ensure that logs are properly flushed when the process terminates. The `LogGuard` automatically handles this as it goes out of scope.
