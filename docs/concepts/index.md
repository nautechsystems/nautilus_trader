Welcome to NautilusTrader!

It's important to note that the [API Reference](../api_reference/index.md) documentation should be 
considered the source of truth for the platform. If there are any discrepancies between concepts described here
and the API Reference, then the API Reference should be considered the correct information. We are 
working to ensure that concepts stay up-to-date with the API Reference and will be introducing 
doc tests in the near future to help with this.

```{note}
The terms "NautilusTrader", "Nautilus" and "platform" are used interchageably throughout the documentation.
