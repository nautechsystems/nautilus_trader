# Orders

This guide provides further details about the available order types for the platform, along with
the execution instructions supported for each.

Orders are one of the fundamental building blocks of any algorithmic trading strategy.
NautilusTrader has unified a large set of order types and execution instructions
from standard to more advanced, to provide as much of a trading venues potential functionality
as possible. This enables traders to define certain conditions and instructions for
order execution and management, facilitating the creation of virtually any type of trading strategy.

## Overview

The two main types of orders are *Market* orders and *Limit* orders. All other order
types are built from these two fundamental order types, in terms of liquidity provision they
are exact opposites, *Market* orders demand liquidity and require immediate trading at the best
price available. Conversely, *Limit* orders provide liquidity, they act as standing orders in a limit order book
at a specified limit price.

The order types available for the platform are (using the enum values):
- `MARKET`
- `LIMIT`
- `STOP_MARKET`
- `STOP_LIMIT`
- `MARKET_TO_LIMIT`
- `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`
- `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`
- `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET`
- `TRAILING_STOP_LIMIT`

:::info
NautilusTrader has unified the API for a large set of order types and execution instructions.
However, these are not necessarily available for every venue. If an order is submitted where an instruction or
option is not available, the system should either **NOT** submit the order and an error will be logged with
a clear explanatory message.
:::

### Terminology

- An order is **aggressive** if its type is `MARKET`, or if its executing as a *marketable* order (i.e., taking liquidity).
- An order is **passive** if not *marketable* (i.e., providing liquidity).
- An order is **active local** if it remains within the local system boundary in one of the following three non-terminal statuses:
    - `INITIALIZED`
    - `EMULATED`
    - `RELEASED`
- An order is **in-flight** when at one of the following statuses:
    - `SUBMITTED`
    - `PENDING_UPDATE`
    - `PENDING_CANCEL`
- An order is **open** when at one of the following (non-terminal) statuses:
    - `ACCEPTED`
    - `TRIGGERED`
    - `PENDING_UPDATE`
    - `PENDING_CANCEL`
    - `PARTIALLY_FILLED`
- An order is **closed** when at one of the following (terminal) statuses:
    - `DENIED`
    - `REJECTED`
    - `CANCELED`
    - `EXPIRED`
    - `FILLED`

## Execution instructions

Certain exchanges allow a trader to specify conditions and restrictions on
how an order will be processed and executed. The following is a brief
summary of the different execution instructions available.

### Time in force

The order's time in force specifies how long the order will remain open or active before any
remaining quantity is canceled.

- `GTC` **(Good-Till-Canceled)**: The order remains active until canceled by the trader or the exchange.
- `IOC` **(Immediate-Or-Cancel / Fill-And-Kill)**: The order executes immediately, with any unfilled portion canceled.
- `FOK` **(Fill-Or-Kill)**: The order executes immediately in full or not at all.
- `GTD` **(Good-Till-Date/Time)**: The order remains active until a specified expiration date and time.
- `DAY` **(Good for session/day)**: The order remains active until the end of the current trading session.
- `AT_THE_OPEN` **(OPG)**: The order is only active at the open of the trading session.
- `AT_THE_CLOSE`: The order is only active at the close of the trading session.

### Expire time

This instruction is to be used in conjunction with the `GTD` time in force to specify the time
at which the order will expire and be removed from the exchanges order book (or order management system).

### Post-only

An order which is marked as `post_only` will only ever participate in providing liquidity to the
limit order book, and never initiating a trade which takes liquidity as an aggressor. This option is
important for market makers, or traders seeking to restrict the order to a liquidity _maker_ fee tier.

### Reduce-only

An order which is set as `reduce_only` will only ever reduce an existing position on an instrument, and
never open a new position (if already flat). The exact behavior of this instruction can vary between
exchanges, however the behavior as per the Nautilus `SimulatedExchange` is typical of a live exchange.

- Order will be canceled if the associated position is closed (becomes flat)
- Order quantity will be reduced as the associated positions size reduces

### Display quantity

The `display_qty` specifies the portion of a *Limit* order which is displayed on the limit order book.
These are also known as iceberg orders as there is a visible portion to be displayed, with more quantity which is hidden.
Specifying a display quantity of zero is also equivalent to setting an order as `hidden`.

### Trigger type

Also known as [trigger method](https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/tws/usersguidebook/configuretws/modify_the_stop_trigger_method.htm)
which is applicable to conditional trigger orders, specifying the method of triggering the stop price.

- `DEFAULT`: The default trigger type for the exchange (typically `LAST` or `BID_ASK`).
- `LAST`: The trigger price will be based on the last traded price.
- `BID_ASK`: The trigger price will be based on the `BID` for buy orders and `ASK` for sell orders.
- `DOUBLE_LAST`: The trigger price will be based on the last two consecutive `LAST` prices.
- `DOUBLE_BID_ASK`: The trigger price will be based on the last two consecutive `BID` or `ASK` prices as applicable.
- `LAST_OR_BID_ASK`: The trigger price will be based on the `LAST` or `BID`/`ASK`.
- `MID_POINT`: The trigger price will be based on the mid-point between the `BID` and `ASK`.
- `MARK`: The trigger price will be based on the exchanges mark price for the instrument.
- `INDEX`: The trigger price will be based on the exchanges index price for the instrument.

### Trigger offset type

Applicable to conditional trailing-stop trigger orders, specifies the method of triggering modification
of the stop price based on the offset from the *market* (bid, ask or last price as applicable).

- `DEFAULT`: The default offset type for the exchange (typically `PRICE`).
- `PRICE`: The offset is based on a price difference.
- `BASIS_POINTS`: The offset is based on a price percentage difference expressed in basis points (100bp = 1%).
- `TICKS`: The offset is based on a number of ticks.
- `PRICE_TIER`: The offset is based on an exchange specific price tier.

### Contingent orders

More advanced relationships can be specified between orders such as assigning child order(s) which will only
trigger when the parent order is activated or filled, or linking orders together which will cancel or reduce in quantity
contingent on each other. More documentation for these options can be found in the [advanced order guide](advanced/advanced_orders.md).

## Order factory

The easiest way to create new orders is by using the built-in `OrderFactory`, which is
automatically attached to every `Strategy` class. This factory will take care
of lower level details - such as ensuring the correct trader ID and strategy ID are assigned, generation
of a necessary initialization ID and timestamp, and abstracts away parameters which don't necessarily
apply to the order type being created, or are only needed to specify more advanced execution instructions.

This leaves the factory with simpler order creation methods to work with, all the
examples will leverage an `OrderFactory` from within a `Strategy` context.

:::info
See the `OrderFactory` [API Reference](../api_reference/common.md#class-orderfactory) for further details.
:::

## Order Types

The following describes the order types which are available for the platform with a code example.
Any optional parameters will be clearly marked with a comment which includes the default value.

### Market

A *Market* order is an instruction by the trader to immediately trade
the given quantity at the best price available. You can also specify several
time in force options, and indicate whether this order is only intended to reduce
a position.

In the following example we create a *Market* order on the Interactive Brokers [IdealPro](https://ibkr.info/node/1708) Forex ECN
to BUY 100,000 AUD using USD:

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import MarketOrder

order: MarketOrder = self.order_factory.market(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("AUD/USD.IDEALPRO"),
    order_side=OrderSide.BUY,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(100_000),
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.IOC,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    reduce_only=False,  # <-- optional (default False)
    tags=["ENTRY"],  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info
See the `MarketOrder` [API Reference](../api_reference/model/orders.md#class-marketorder) for further details.
:::

### Limit

A *Limit* order is placed on the limit order book at a specific price, and will only
execute at that price (or better).

In the following example we create a *Limit* order on the Binance Futures Crypto exchange to SELL 20 ETHUSDT-PERP Perpetual Futures
contracts at a limit price of 5000 USDT, as a market maker.

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Price
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import LimitOrder

order: LimitOrder = self.order_factory.limit(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("ETHUSDT-PERP.BINANCE"),
    order_side=OrderSide.SELL,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(20),
    price=Price.from_str("5_000.00"),
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.GTC,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    expire_time=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
    post_only=True,  # <-- optional (default False)
    reduce_only=False,  # <-- optional (default False)
    display_qty=None,  # <-- optional (default None which indicates full display)
    tags=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info
See the `LimitOrder` [API Reference](../api_reference/model/orders.md#class-limitorder) for further details.
:::

### Stop-Market

A *Stop-Market* order is a conditional order which once triggered, will immediately
place a *Market* order. This order type is often used as a stop-loss to limit losses, either
as a SELL order against LONG positions, or as a BUY order against SHORT positions.

In the following example we create a *Stop-Market* order on the Binance Spot/Margin exchange
to SELL 1 BTC at a trigger price of 100,000 USDT, active until further notice:

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Price
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import StopMarketOrder

order: StopMarketOrder = self.order_factory.stop_market(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("BTCUSDT.BINANCE"),
    order_side=OrderSide.SELL,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(1),
    trigger_price=Price.from_int(100_000),
    trigger_type=TriggerType.LAST_PRICE,  # <-- optional (default DEFAULT)
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.GTC,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    expire_time=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
    reduce_only=False,  # <-- optional (default False)
    tags=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info
See the `StopMarketOrder` [API Reference](../api_reference/model/orders.md#class-stopmarketorder) for further details.
:::

### Stop-Limit

A *Stop-Limit* order is a conditional order which once triggered will immediately place
a *Limit* order at the specified price.

In the following example we create a *Stop-Limit* order on the Currenex FX ECN to BUY 50,000 GBP at a limit price of 1.3000 USD
once the market hits the trigger price of 1.30010 USD, active until midday 6th June, 2022 (UTC):

```python
import pandas as pd
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Price
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import StopLimitOrder

order: StopLimitOrder = self.order_factory.stop_limit(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("GBP/USD.CURRENEX"),
    order_side=OrderSide.BUY,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(50_000),
    price=Price.from_str("1.30000"),
    trigger_price=Price.from_str("1.30010"),
    trigger_type=TriggerType.BID,  # <-- optional (default DEFAULT)
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.GTD,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    expire_time=pd.Timestamp("2022-06-06T12:00"),
    post_only=True,  # <-- optional (default False)
    reduce_only=False,  # <-- optional (default False)
    tags=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info
See the `StopLimitOrder` [API Reference](../api_reference/model/orders.md#class-stoplimitorder) for further details.
:::

### Market-To-Limit

A *Market-To-Limit* order is submitted as a market order to execute at the current best market price.
If the order is only partially filled, the remainder of the order is canceled and re-submitted as a *Limit* order with
the limit price equal to the price at which the filled portion of the order executed.

In the following example we create a *Market-To-Limit* order on the Interactive Brokers [IdealPro](https://ibkr.info/node/1708) Forex ECN
to BUY 200,000 USD using JPY:

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import MarketToLimitOrder

order: MarketToLimitOrder = self.order_factory.market_to_limit(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("USD/JPY.IDEALPRO"),
    order_side=OrderSide.BUY,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(200_000),
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.GTC,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    reduce_only=False,  # <-- optional (default False)
    display_qty=None,  # <-- optional (default None which indicates full display)
    tags=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info

:::

### Market-If-Touched

A *Market-If-Touched* order is a conditional order which once triggered will immediately
place a *Market* order. This order type is often used to enter a new position on a stop price,
or to take profits for an existing position, either as a SELL order against LONG positions,
or as a BUY order against SHORT positions.

In the following example we create a *Market-If-Touched* order on the Binance Futures exchange
to SELL 10 ETHUSDT-PERP Perpetual Futures contracts at a trigger price of 10,000 USDT, active until further notice:

```python
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Price
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import MarketIfTouchedOrder

order: MarketIfTouchedOrder = self.order_factory.market_if_touched(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("ETHUSDT-PERP.BINANCE"),
    order_side=OrderSide.SELL,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(10),
    trigger_price=Price.from_str("10_000.00"),
    trigger_type=TriggerType.LAST_PRICE,  # <-- optional (default DEFAULT)
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.GTC,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    expire_time=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
    reduce_only=False,  # <-- optional (default False)
    tags=["ENTRY"],  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info
See the `MarketIfTouchedOrder` [API Reference](../api_reference/model/orders.md#class-marketiftouchedorder) for further details.
:::

### Limit-If-Touched

A *Limit-If-Touched* order is a conditional order which once triggered will immediately place
a *Limit* order at the specified price.

In the following example we create a *Stop-Limit* order to BUY 5 BTCUSDT-PERP Perpetual Futures contracts on the
Binance Futures exchange at a limit price of 30,100 USDT (once the market hits the trigger price of 30,150 USDT),
active until midday 6th June, 2022 (UTC):

```python
import pandas as pd
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Price
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import LimitIfTouched

order: LimitIfTouched = self.order_factory.limit_if_touched(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("BTCUSDT-PERP.BINANCE"),
    order_side=OrderSide.BUY,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(5),

### Trailing-Stop-Market

A *Trailing-Stop-Market* order is a conditional order which trails a stop trigger price
a fixed offset away from the defined market price. Once triggered a *Market* order will
immediately be placed.

In the following example we create a *Trailing-Stop-Market* order on the Binance Futures exchange to SELL 10 ETHUSD-PERP COIN_M margined
Perpetual Futures Contracts activating at a trigger price of 5,000 USD, then trailing at an offset of 1% (in basis points) away from the current last traded price:

```python
import pandas as pd
from decimal import Decimal
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TrailingOffsetType
from nautilus_trader.model import InstrumentId
from nautilus_trader.model import Price
from nautilus_trader.model import Quantity
from nautilus_trader.model import TrailingStopMarketOrder

order: TrailingStopMarketOrder = self.order_factory.trailing_stop_market(
    instrument_id=InstrumentId.from_str("ETHUSD-PERP.BINANCE"),
    order_side=OrderSide.SELL,
    quantity=Quantity.from_int(10),
    trigger_price=Price.from_str("5_000"),
    trigger_type=TriggerType.LAST_PRICE,  # <-- optional (default DEFAULT)
    trailing_offset=Decimal(100),
    trailing_offset_type=TrailingOffsetType.BASIS_POINTS,
    time_in_force=TimeInForce.GTC,  # <-- optional (default GTC)
    expire_time=None,  # <-- optional (default None)
    reduce_only=True,  # <-- optional (default False)
    tags=["TRAILING_STOP-1"],  # <-- optional (default None)
)
```

:::info

:::

### Trailing-Stop-Limit

A *Trailing-Stop-Limit* order is a conditional order which trails a stop trigger price
a fixed offset away from the defined market price. Once triggered a *Limit* order will
immediately be placed at the defined price (which is also updated as the market moves until triggered).

In the following example we create a *Trailing-Stop-Limit* order on the Currenex FX ECN to BUY 1,250,000 AUD using USD
at a limit price of 0.71000 USD, activating at 0.72000 USD then trailing at a stop offset of 0.00100 USD
away from the current ask price, active until further notice:

```python
import pandas as pd
from decimal import Decimal
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import OrderSide
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TimeInForce
from nautilus_trader.model.enums import TriggerType

## Advanced Orders

The following guide should be read in conjunction with the specific documentation from the broker or exchange
involving these order types, lists/groups and execution instructions (such as for Interactive Brokers).

### Order Lists

Combinations of contingent orders, or larger order bulks can be grouped together into a list with a common
`order_list_id`. The orders contained in this list may or may not have a contingent relationship with
each other, as this is specific to how the orders themselves are constructed, and the
specific exchange they are being routed to.

### Contingency Types

- `OTO` are parent orders with 'one-triggers-other' child orders.
- `OCO` are linked orders with `linked_order_ids` which are contingent on the other(s) (one-cancels-other when triggered).
- `OUO` are linked orders with `linked_order_ids` which are contingent on the other(s) (one-updates-other when triggered or modified).

:::info
These contingency types relate to ContingencyType FIX tag <1385> https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/5.0.sp2/tagnum_1385.html.
:::

#### One Triggers the Other (OTO)

An OTO orders involves two orders—a parent order and a child order. The parent order is a live
marketplace order. The child order, held in a separate order file, is not. If the parent order
executes in full, the child order is released to the marketplace and becomes live.
An OTO order can be made up of stock orders, option orders, or a combination of both.

#### One Cancels the Other (OCO)

An OCO order is an order whose execution results in the immediate cancellation of another order
linked to it. Cancellation of the Contingent Order happens on a best efforts basis.
In an OCO order, both orders are live in the marketplace at the same time. The execution of either
order triggers an attempt to cancel the other unexecuted order. Partial executions will also trigger an attempt to cancel the other order.

#### One Updates the Other (OUO)

An OUO order is an order whose execution results in the immediate reduction of quantity in another
order linked to it. The quantity reduction happens on a best effort basis. In an OUO order both
orders are live in the marketplace at the same time. The execution of either order triggers an
attempt to reduce the remaining quantity of the other order, partial executions included.

### Bracket Orders

Bracket orders are an advanced order type that allows traders to set both take-profit and stop-loss
levels for a position simultaneously. This involves placing a parent order (entry order) and two child
orders: a take-profit `LIMIT` order and a stop-loss `STOP_MARKET` order. When the parent order is executed,
the child orders are placed in the market. The take-profit order closes the position with profits if
the market moves favorably, while the stop-loss order limits losses if the market moves unfavorably.

Bracket orders can be easily created using the [OrderFactory](../../api_reference/common.md#class-orderfactory),
which supports various order types, parameters, and instructions.

:::warning
You should be aware of the margin requirements of positions, as bracketing a position will consume
more order margin.
:::

## Emulated Orders

### Introduction

Before diving into the technical details, it's important to understand the fundamental purpose of emulated orders
in Nautilus Trader. At its core, emulation allows you to use certain order types even when your trading venue
doesn't natively support them.

This works by having Nautilus locally mimic the behavior of these order types (such as `STOP_LIMIT` or `TRAILING_STOP` orders)
locally, while using only simple `MARKET` and `LIMIT` orders for actual execution on the venue.

When you create an emulated order, Nautilus continuously tracks a specific type of market price (specified by the
`emulation_trigger` parameter) and based on the order type and conditions you've set, will automatically submit
the appropriate fundamental order (`MARKET` / `LIMIT`) when the triggering condition is met.

For example, if you create an emulated `STOP_LIMIT` order, Nautilus will monitor the market price until your `stop`
price is reached, and then automatically submits a `LIMIT` order to the venue.

To perform emulation, Nautilus needs to know which **type of market price** it should monitor.
By default, it uses bid and ask prices (quotes), which is why you'll often see `emulation_trigger=TriggerType.DEFAULT`
in examples (this is equivalent to using `TriggerType.BID_ASK`). However, Nautilus supports various other price types,
that can guide the emulation process.

### Submitting order for emulation

The only requirement to emulate an order is to pass a `TriggerType` to the `emulation_trigger`
parameter of an `Order` constructor, or `OrderFactory` creation method. The following
emulation trigger types are currently supported:

- `NO_TRIGGER`: disables local emulation completely and order is fully submitted to the exchange.
- `DEFAULT`: which is the same as `BID_ASK`.
- `BID_ASK`: emulated using quotes to trigger.
- `LAST`: emulated using trades to trigger.

The choice of trigger type determines how the order emulation will behave:

- For `STOP` orders, the trigger price of order will be compared against the specified trigger type.
- For `TRAILING_STOP` orders, the trailing offset will be updated based on the specified trigger type.
- For `LIMIT` orders, the limit price of order will be compared against the specified trigger type.

Here are all the available values you can set into `emulation_trigger` parameter and their purposes:

| Trigger Type      | Description                                                                                          | Common use cases                                                                                             |
|:------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NO_TRIGGER`      | Disables emulation completely. The order is sent directly to the venue without any local processing. | When you want to use the venue's native order handling, or for simple order types that don't need emulation. |
| `DEFAULT`         | Same as `BID_ASK`. This is the standard choice for most emulated orders.                             | General-purpose emulation when you want to work with the "default" type of market prices.                    |
| `BID_ASK`         | Uses the best bid and ask prices (quotes) to guide emulation.                                        | Stop orders, trailing stops, and other orders that should react to the current market spread.                |
| `LAST_PRICE`      | Uses the price of the most recent trade to guide emulation.                                          | Orders that should trigger based on actual executed trades rather than quotes.                               |
| `DOUBLE_LAST`     | Uses two consecutive last trade prices to confirm the trigger condition.                             | When you want additional confirmation of price movement before triggering.                                   |
| `DOUBLE_BID_ASK`  | Uses two consecutive bid/ask price updates to confirm the trigger condition.                         | When you want extra confirmation of quote movements before triggering.                                       |
| `LAST_OR_BID_ASK` | Triggers on either last trade price or bid/ask prices.                                               | When you want to be more responsive to any type of price movement.                                           |
| `MID_POINT`       | Uses the middle point between the best bid and ask prices.                                           | Orders that should trigger based on the theoretical fair price.                                              |
| `MARK_PRICE`      | Uses the mark price (common in derivatives markets) for triggering.                                  | Particularly useful for futures and perpetual contracts.                                                     |
| `INDEX_PRICE`     | Uses an underlying index price for triggering.                                                       | When trading derivatives that track an index.                                                                |

### Technical implementation

The platform makes it possible to emulate most order types locally, regardless
of whether the type is supported on a trading venue. The logic and code paths for
order emulation are exactly the same for all [environment contexts](/concepts/architecture.md#environment-contexts)
and utilize a common `OrderEmulator` component.

:::note
There is no limitation on the number of emulated orders you can have per running instance.
:::

### Life cycle

An emulated order will progress through the following stages:

1. Submitted by a `Strategy` through the `submit_order` method
2. Sent to the `RiskEngine` for pre-trade risk checks (it may be denied at this point)
3. Sent to the `OrderEmulator` where it is *held* / emulated
4. Once triggered, emulated order is transformed into a `MARKET` or `LIMIT` order and released (submitted to the exchange)
5. Released order undergoes final risk checks before venue submission

:::note
Emulated orders are subject to the same risk controls as *regular* orders, and can be
modified and canceled by a trading strategy in the normal way. They will also be included
when canceling all orders.
:::

:::info
An emulated order will retain its original client order ID throughout its entire life cycle, making it easy to query
through the cache.
:::

#### Held emulated orders

The following will occur for an emulated order now *held* by the `OrderEmulator` component:

- The original `SubmitOrder` command will be cached.
- The emulated order will be processed inside a local `MatchingCore` component.
- The `OrderEmulator` will subscribe to any needed market data (if not already) to update the matching core.
- The emulated order can be modified (by the trader) and updated (by the market) until *released* or canceled.

#### Released emulated orders

Once an emulated order is triggered / matched locally based on the arrival of data, the following
*release* actions will occur:

- The order will be transformed to either a `MARKET` or `LIMIT` order (see below table) through an additional `OrderInitialized` event.
- The orders `emulation_trigger` will be set to `NONE` (it will no longer be treated as an emulated order by any component).
- The order attached to the original `SubmitOrder` command will be sent back to the `RiskEngine` for additional checks since any modification/updates.
- If not denied, then the command will continue to the `ExecutionEngine` and on to the trading venue via an `ExecutionClient` as normal.

The following table lists which order types are possible to emulate, and
which order type they transform to when being released for submission to the
trading venue.

### Order types, which can be emulated

The following table lists which order types are possible to emulate, and
which order type they transform to when being released for submission to the
trading venue.

| Order type for emulation | Can emulate | Released type |
|:-------------------------|:------------|:--------------|
| `MARKET`                 |             | n/a           |
| `MARKET_TO_LIMIT`        |             | n/a           |
| `LIMIT`                  | ✓           | `MARKET`      |
| `STOP_MARKET`            | ✓           | `MARKET`      |
| `STOP_LIMIT`             | ✓           | `LIMIT`       |
| `MARKET_IF_TOUCHED`      | ✓           | `MARKET`      |
| `LIMIT_IF_TOUCHED`       | ✓           | `LIMIT`       |
| `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET`   | ✓           | `MARKET`      |
| `TRAILING_STOP_LIMIT`    | ✓           | `LIMIT`       |

### Querying

When writing trading strategies, it may be necessary to know the state of emulated orders in the system.
There are several ways to query emulation status:

#### Through the Cache

The following `Cache` methods are available:
- `self.cache.orders_emulated(...)`: Returns all currently emulated orders
- `self.cache.is_order_emulated(...)`: Checks if a specific order is emulated
- `self.cache.orders_emulated_count(...)`: Returns the count of emulated orders

See the full [API reference](../../api_reference/cache) for additional details.

#### Direct order queries

You can query order objects directly using:
- `order.is_emulated`

If either of these return `False`, then the order has been *released* from the
`OrderEmulator`, and so is no longer considered an emulated order (or was never an emulated order).

:::warning
It's not advised to hold a local reference to an emulated order, as the order
object will be transformed when/if the emulated order is *released*. You should rely
on the `Cache` which is made for the job.
:::

### Persistence and recovery

If a running system either crashes or shuts down with active emulated orders, then
they will be reloaded inside the `OrderEmulator` from any configured cache database.
This ensures order state persistence across system restarts and recoveries.

### Best practices

When working with emulated orders, consider the following best practices:

1. Always use the `Cache` for querying or tracking emulated orders rather than storing local references
2. Be aware that emulated orders transform to different types when released
3. Remember that emulated orders undergo risk checks both at submission and release

:::note
Order emulation allows you to use advanced order types even on venues that don't natively support them,
making your trading strategies more portable across different venues.
