# Getting Started

Welcome to the NautilusTrader getting started guide!

The NautilusTrader project is now quite large and feature rich, getting up and 
running can appear difficult and overwhelming at first.

We recommend you first review the [installation](1_installation.md) guide to ensure that NautilusTrader
is properly installed on your machine.
