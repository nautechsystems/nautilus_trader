class Strategy(Actor):
    """
    The base class for all trading strategies.

    This class allows traders to implement their own customized trading strategies.
    A trading strategy can configure its own order management system type, which
    determines how positions are handled by the `ExecutionEngine`.

    Strategy OMS (Order Management System) types:
     - ``UNSPECIFIED``: No specific type has been configured, will therefore
       default to the native OMS type for each venue.
     - ``HEDGING``: A position ID will be assigned for each new position which
       is opened per instrument.
     - ``NETTING``: There will only be a single position for the strategy per
       instrument. The position ID naming convention is `{instrument_id}-{strategy_id}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config : StrategyConfig, optional
        The trading strategy configuration.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If `config` is not of type `StrategyConfig`.

    Warnings
    --------
    - This class should not be used directly, but through a concrete subclass.
    - Do not call components such as `clock` and `logger` in the `__init__` prior to registration.
