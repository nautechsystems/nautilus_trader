        If the client order ID is duplicate, then the order will be denied.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : Order
            The order to submit.
        parent_order_id : ClientOrderId, optional
            The parent client order identifier. If provided then will be considered a child order
            of the parent.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `order.status` is not ``INITIALIZED`` or ``RELEASED``.
        ValueError
            If `order.emulation_trigger` is not ``NO_TRIGGER``.

        Warning
        -------
        If a `position_id` is passed and a position does not yet exist, then any
        position opened by the order will have this position ID assigned. This may
        not be what you intended.

        Emulated orders cannot be sent from execution algorithms (intentionally constraining complexity).

        Modify the given order with optional parameters and routing instructions.

        An `ModifyOrder` command will be created and then sent to the `RiskEngine`.

        At least one value must differ from the original order for the command to be valid.

        Will use an Order Cancel/Replace Request (a.k.a Order Modification)
        for FIX protocols, otherwise if order update is not available for
        the API, then will cancel and replace with a new order using the
        original `ClientOrderId`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order : Order
            The order to update.

        client_id : ClientId, optional
            The specific client ID for the command.
            If ``None`` then will be inferred from the venue in the instrument ID.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `price` is not ``None`` and order does not have a `price`.
        ValueError
            If `trigger` is not ``None`` and order does not have a `trigger_price`.

        Warnings
        --------
        If the order is already closed or at `PENDING_CANCEL` status
        then the command will not be generated, and a warning will be logged.
