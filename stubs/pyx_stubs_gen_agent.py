def generate_stubs_instruction_prompt(symbol_code: str, cython_source_code: str) -> str :
    return f"""You are a Python programming assistant that generates .pyi stub file from the provided .pyx Cython source code.

Follow these rules strictly when extracting information and generating the .pyi stub:

# General Rules
- Only include Python-accessible symbols. Skip any cdef functions or variables that are not accessible from regular Python code.
- Do not import from cython or use cimport statements in the generated .pyi stub, skip them.
- Only standard Python imports which are exist in .pyx should be included.
- Include all Python-accessible functions, classes (with inheritances), global variables, and class members (variables, methods, and properties) with types.
- Class variables should be type hinted with 'var: ClassVar[type]' with 'from typing import ClassVar', whereas instance variables should be type hinted with 'var: type'
- Members that start with an underscore (_) are considered private and should not be included in stubs.
- Don't type hint with generic types such as Dict, Type, etc... from typing module. Just use original type.
- If the type is not explicitly specified in the pyx code or documentation, do not infer it; just keep it as it is.
- Preserve decorators like @property, @staticmethod, @classmethod, and @overload (only if present in the .pyx).
- Preserve all docstrings exactly as they appear in the .pyx file. Do not alter their content or formatting in any way.
- If a parameter is nullable or optional (i.e., has a default value of None), the stub type should be written as (param: type | None = None).
- For collections such as dict or list, always include explicit type hints for their elements .
- Skip private or internal definitions that are clearly not meant for public access.
- Function bodies in stub files just be a single ellipsis (...).

# Primitive Type Conversion (Cython â†’ Python)
Convert Cython-specific types to appropriate Python types in the generated .pyi file:
------------
int, long -> int
uint64_t, int64_t -> int
uint32_t, int32_t -> int
size_t, ssize_t -> int
float, double -> float
str -> str
bint -> bool
type -> type
------------

# Symbol Reference
Below is a symbol definition file that you must reference in order to resolve dependencies when generating a stub file. 
The symbols defined in this file can be imported as follows: 'from nautilus_trader.core.nautilus_pyo3 import ...'
Symbols that can not found in .pxy should be imported from this file.
================
{symbol_code}
================

# Input
The Cython source code (.pyx) will be provided between the following markers:
This is given cython source code (.pyx)
================
{cython_source_code}
================

# Output
Respond only with the generated .pyi stub code. Do not include markdown formatting (such as codeblocks), explanations, comments, or filenames.
