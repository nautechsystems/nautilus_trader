//! Order execution engine for [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io).
//!
//! The `nautilus-execution` crate provides a comprehensive order execution system that handles the complete
//! order lifecycle from submission to fill processing. This includes sophisticated order matching,
//! execution venue integration, and advanced order type emulation:
//!
//! - **Execution engine**: Central orchestration of order routing and position management.
//! - **Order matching engine**: High-fidelity market simulation for backtesting and paper trading.
//! - **Order emulator**: Advanced order types not natively supported by venues (trailing stops, contingent orders).
//! - **Execution clients**: Abstract interfaces for connecting to trading venues and brokers.
//! - **Order manager**: Local order lifecycle management and state tracking.
//! - **Matching core**: Low-level order book and price-time priority matching algorithms.
//! - **Fee and fill models**: Configurable execution cost simulation and realistic fill behavior.
//!
//! The crate supports both live trading environments (with real execution clients) and simulated
//! environments (with matching engines), making it suitable for production trading, strategy
//! development, and comprehensive backtesting.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
//! algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
//! portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
//! and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.
//!
//! NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
//! highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `ffi`: Enables the C foreign function interface (FFI) from [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen).
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.
