//! Core foundational types and utilities for [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io).
//!
//! The `nautilus-core` crate is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and to provide zero-cost abstractions
//! wherever possible. It supplies the essential building blocks used across the NautilusTrader
//! ecosystem, including:
//!
//! - Time handling and atomic clock functionality.
//! - UUID generation and management.
//! - Mathematical functions and interpolation utilities.
//! - Correctness validation functions.
//! - Serialization traits and helpers.
//! - Cross-platform environment utilities.
//! - Abstractions over common collections.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
//! algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
//! portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
//! and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.
//!
//! NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
//! highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `ffi`: Enables the C foreign function interface (FFI) from [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen).
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.

/// Mutex guards should use `expect` rather than handle poison errors.
/// A poisoned mutex indicates a thread panicked while holding the lock,
/// meaning protected data may be in an inconsistent state. Propagating
/// the panic is the idiomatic and safe approach, as continuing with
/// potentially corrupted data would violate safety invariants.
