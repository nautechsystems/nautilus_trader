//! Efficient and ergonomic wrappers around frequently-used `Rc<RefCell<T>>` / `Weak<RefCell<T>>` pairs.
//!
//! The NautilusTrader codebase heavily relies on shared, interior-mutable ownership for many
//! engine components (`Rc<RefCell<T>>`). Repeating that verbose type across many APIs—alongside
//! its weak counterpart—clutters code and increases the likelihood of accidentally storing a
//! strong reference where only a weak reference is required (leading to reference cycles).
//!
//! `SharedCell<T>` and `WeakCell<T>` are zero-cost new-types that make the intent explicit and
//! offer convenience helpers (`downgrade`, `upgrade`, `borrow`, `borrow_mut`). Because the
//! wrappers are `#[repr(transparent)]`, they have the exact same memory layout as the wrapped
//! `Rc` / `Weak` and introduce no runtime overhead.

//! ## Choosing between `SharedCell` and `WeakCell`
//!
//! * Use **`SharedCell<T>`** when the current owner genuinely *owns* (or co-owns) the value –
//!   just as you would normally store an `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.
//! * Use **`WeakCell<T>`** for back-references that could otherwise form a reference cycle.
//!   The back-pointer does **not** keep the value alive, and every access must first
//!   `upgrade()` to a strong `SharedCell`. This pattern is how we break circular ownership such
//!   as *Exchange ↔ ExecutionClient*: the exchange keeps a `SharedCell` to the client, while the
//!   client holds only a `WeakCell` back to the exchange.
