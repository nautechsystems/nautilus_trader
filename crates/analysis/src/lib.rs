//! Portfolio analysis and performance metrics for [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io).
//!
//! The `nautilus-analysis` crate provides a comprehensive suite of portfolio analysis tools and performance
//! statistics for evaluating trading strategies and portfolios. This includes return-based metrics,
//! PnL-based statistics, and risk measurements commonly used in quantitative finance:
//!
//! - Portfolio analyzer for tracking account states and positions.
//! - Extensive collection of performance statistics and risk metrics.
//! - Flexible statistic calculation framework supporting different data sources.
//! - Support for multi-currency portfolios and unrealized PnL calculations.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
//! algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
//! portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
//! and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.
//!
//! NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
//! highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.
