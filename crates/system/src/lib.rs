//! System-level components and orchestration for NautilusTrader.
//!
//! This crate provides the core system architecture for orchestrating trading systems,
//! including the kernel that manages all engines, configuration management,
//! and system-level factories for creating components.
//!
//! The main components include:
//! - [`NautilusKernel`] - Core system orchestrator managing engines and components.
//! - [`NautilusKernelConfig`] - Configuration for kernel initialization.
//! - System builders and factories for component creation.
//!
//! [`NautilusKernel`]: kernel::NautilusKernel
//!
//! [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
//! algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
//! portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
//! and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
