[NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) adapter for [Tardis](https://tardis.dev).

The `nautilus-tardis` crate provides integration with the Tardis API for accessing
normalized historical and real-time market data across multiple exchanges.

## Platform

[NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.

NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.

## Feature flags

This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
depending on the intended use case:

- `replay`: Enables market data replay functionality (enabled by default).
- `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.
- `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
