//! Live system node for [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io).
//!
//! The `nautilus-live` crate provides high-level abstractions and infrastructure for running live trading
//! systems, including data streaming, execution management, and system lifecycle handling.
//! It builds on top of the system kernel to provide simplified interfaces for live deployment:
//!
//! - `LiveNode` High-level abstraction for live system nodes.
//! - `LiveNodeConfig` Configuration for live node deployment.
//! - `AsyncRunner` for managing system real-time data flow.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
//! algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
//! portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
//! and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.
//!
//! NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
//! highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `ffi`: Enables the C foreign function interface (FFI) from [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen).
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `defi`: Enables DeFi (Decentralized Finance) support.
//! - `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.
