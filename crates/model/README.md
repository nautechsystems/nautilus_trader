Trading domain model for [NautilusTrader](https://nautilustrader.io).

The `nautilus-model` crate provides a type-safe domain model that forms the backbone of the framework
and can serve as the foundation for building algorithmic trading systems.

## NautilusTrader

[NautilusTrader](https://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, production-grade, Rust-native
engine for multi-asset, multi-venue trading systems.

The system spans research, deterministic simulation, and live execution within a single
event-driven architecture, providing research-to-live semantic parity.
