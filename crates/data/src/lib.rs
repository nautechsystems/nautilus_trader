//! Data engine and market data processing for [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io).
//!
//! The `nautilus-data` crate provides a comprehensive framework for handling market data ingestion,
//! processing, and aggregation within the NautilusTrader ecosystem. This includes real-time
//! data streaming, historical data management, and various aggregation methodologies:
//!
//! - High-performance data engine for orchestrating data operations.
//! - Data client infrastructure for connecting to market data providers.
//! - Bar aggregation machinery supporting tick, volume, value, and time-based aggregation.
//! - Order book management and delta processing capabilities.
//! - Subscription management and data request handling.
//! - Configurable data routing and processing pipelines.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! [NautilusTrader](http://nautilustrader.io) is an open-source, high-performance, production-grade
//! algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
//! portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,
//! and also deploy those same strategies live, with no code changes.
//!
//! NautilusTrader's design, architecture, and implementation philosophy prioritizes software correctness and safety at the
//! highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
//! depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
//! for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
//! or as part of a Rust only build.
//!
//! - `ffi`: Enables the C foreign function interface (FFI) from [cbindgen](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen).
//! - `python`: Enables Python bindings from [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).
//! - `high-precision`: Enables [high-precision mode](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/nightly/getting_started/installation#precision-mode) to use 128-bit value types.
//! - `defi`: Enables DeFi (Decentralized Finance) support.
//! - `extension-module`: Builds the crate as a Python extension module.
