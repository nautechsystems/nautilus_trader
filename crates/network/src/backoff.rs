//! Provides an implementation of an exponential backoff mechanism with jitter support.
//! It is used for managing reconnection delays in the socket clients.
//!
//! The backoff mechanism allows the delay to grow exponentially up to a configurable
//! maximum, optionally applying random jitter to avoid synchronized reconnection storms.
//! An "immediate first" flag is available so that the very first reconnect attempt
//! can occur without any delay.
