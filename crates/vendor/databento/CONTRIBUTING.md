Thank you for taking the time to contribute to our project.
We welcome feedback through discussions and issues on GitHub, as well as our [community Slack](https://databento.com/support).
While we don't merge pull requests directly due to the open-source repository being a downstream
mirror of our internal codebase, we can commit the changes upstream with the original author.
