algorithmic trading platform, providing quantitative traders with the ability to backtest
portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine,

highest level, with the aim of supporting mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.

## Feature flags

This crate provides feature flags to control source code inclusion during compilation,
depending on the intended use case, i.e. whether to provide Python bindings
for the [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader) Python package,
or as part of a Rust only build.
