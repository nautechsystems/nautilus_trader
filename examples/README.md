# Examples

The following code examples are organized by system environment context:
- **Backtest**: Historical data with simulated venues
- **Sandbox**: Real-time data with simulated venues
- **Live**: Real-time data with live venues (paper trading or real accounts)

Within each environment context directory, are scripts organized by integration.

Ensure that the `nautilus_trader` package is either compiled from source or installed via pip before
running the examples. See the [installation guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation)
for more information.

To execute an example script from the `examples` directory, use a command similar to the following:
```
python backtest/crypto_ema_cross_ethusdt_trade_ticks.py
```
