# Ignores justification
# ---------------------
# E225 missing whitespace around operator (picks up cython casting)
# E252 spaces around default argument assignment (incorrect syntax)
# E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax (cimport seen as invalid syntax)

# Documentation ignores (will be addressed)

# D100 Missing docstring in public module (todo: picks up entire test suite)
# D101 Missing docstring in public class  (todo: picks up entire test suite)
# D102 Missing docstring in public class  (todo: picks up entire test suite)
# D104 Missing docstring in public package (todo to complete)
# D200 One-line docstring should fit on one line with quotes (conflicts with Codacy)
