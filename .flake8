# Ignores justification
# ---------------------
# B305 `.next()` is not a thing on Python 3. (incorrectly picking up methods named next)
# D100 Missing docstring in public module (picks up entire test suite)
# D101 Missing docstring in public class (picks up entire test suite)
# D102 Missing docstring in public method (picks up entire test suite)
# E203 whitespace before ':' (conflicts with Black)
# E225 missing whitespace around operator (picks up cython casting)
# E227 missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator (picks up pointers)
# E252 spaces around default argument assignment (incorrect syntax)
# E402 module level import not at top of file (workaround to assist imports in examples)
# E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax (cimport seen as invalid syntax)
# S101 Use of assert detected (use of assert normal for pytest)
# S403 S403 Consider possible security implications associated with pickle module (pickle ok!)
# W503: in error will be amended by flake8 soon (https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html)
