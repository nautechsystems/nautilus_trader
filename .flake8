# Ignores justification
# ---------------------
# E225 missing whitespace around operator (picks up cython casting)
# E252 spaces around default argument assignment (incorrect syntax)
# E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax (cimport seen as invalid syntax)
# W293 blank line contains whitespace (temporarily until pycharm strips from
# docstring blank lines).
# E501 line too long (problems mainly in test suite)
