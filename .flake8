# Ignores justification
# ---------------------
# Excluded stats.py and utils.py is temporary third-party code
# E225 missing whitespace around operator (picks up cython casting)
# E252 spaces around default argument assignment (incorrect syntax)
# E999 SyntaxError: invalid syntax (cimport seen as invalid syntax)

# Documentation ignores (will be addressed)
# -----------------------------------------
# D100 Missing docstring in public module
# D101 Missing docstring in public class
# D104 Missing docstring in public package
# D200 One-line docstring should fit on one line with quotes (conflicts with Codacy)
# D400 First line should end with a period
